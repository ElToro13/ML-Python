﻿Excellent, , , 
﻿Friendly fun and a great learning experience, Working for the company gives you great access to a wealth of experience and insight into the corporate world. The company benefits are also a positive as well as the UK company culture., The role itself can be overwhelming at times., 
﻿Honest review, 1. The customers. I’ve worked at traditional private hire firms and it has to be said the people that use Uber tend to be a lot better then working at private hire firms. Uber passengers tend to be a lot more respectful which is nice. You will get the odd rude customer here and there but it is very rare in my experience being an Uber driver. 2. When it’s busy it’s good ! Goes without saying this but when it is busy..., 1. There is way to many drivers ! The main reason why I left Uber because of this. Leeds has a massive amount of “out of town” drivers in Leeds. This means surrounding areas such as Bradford Wakefield Kirklees and a few others can work in Leeds. It adds to the already high number of Uber drivers in Leeds. Not to mention this should not be allowed in the first place. 2. When students go work goes. 3. When it’s..., 25% is robbery! The fairs are to low. Sort this out of town driver mess and stop taking so many drivers on.
﻿Terrible pay, You work when you want that's it., Terrible pay stuck up rude & arrogant customers horrific traffic., Lower driver commission of course you won't because you don't really care.
﻿Uber eats drivers/roders Modern day slaves, You can choose when to work You get paid on time every week, You get paid £2.50 per hour in some areas in London as you get one job. So many riders/drivers that leads to a less jobs for all drivers Uber doesn’t tell you how much they are going to pay you per drop until you finish the job Stuart and Deliveroo at least they tell you how much they gonna pay you before you accept the job!, Bring back the old payment system when you were paying £4.25 per drop and stop employing drivers as there is no enough jobs!
﻿Absolutely disgraceful company to work for, Currently nothing I can think of, - Dead periods lasting months when you earn way below minimum wages It seems like whole summer time is completely dead Monday to Friday with just few hours on Saturday and Sunday when you can earn maybe £10 per hours after deducting expenses the rest of the weeks you can stay logged in for hours and won't earn a penny making it the most boring job that you do for free. This situation is most probably caused by geniuses..., read the review
﻿Restaurant partner, Great opportunity for marketing purposes., No one to actually talk to it’s as if your talking to robots and handling issues can take weeks, Employ account managers that you can speak to over the phone.
﻿Losing account with no info, Earn well for riding a bicycle business generally backs up it's sub contractor very flexible. The work personally is amazing just need to except certain realities of the business model. Nothing is perfect. ., Account being put on hold with no call or sufficient notification and after a few days of stress and anguish at not knowing why you have lost your ability to earn money. Plus whether you will pay your bills that month. Fluctuations in supply and demand eaters and drivers causes issues too but this doesn't bother me. You just have to be clever but the tensions that arise when people realise they can't earn what they use..., Talk to your couriers/driver before action is taken. These processes of conduct are extremely mentally damaging and will result in suicides

﻿UberEats Driver, Flexible time: you can work anytime you want., Very low pay and you have to work very long hour., 
﻿Want an honest view of Uber?, Flexible hours (as with any private hire taxi firm) - Sick pay of sorts - increased fares on occasion due to the uber surge, Firm seems more interested in making sure customers are happy than if the drivers or as they call us "partners" are happy No extra money for working the festive season unlike any other private hire taxi firm, listen more to driver/partners charge customers 1.5 x over festive period as other firms do. increase office availability for drivers 9-5 Mon to Fri
﻿Uber Eats Motorcycle, The hours are very Flexible, Too many couriers No jobs Terrible surcharge system, 
﻿Uber, Not much care for the drivers will drop you like a shot if need be. I see so many people crying going into their offices begging to take off their suspension., Take care of your drivers just as much as you take care of the customers. Without no drivers there no customers., 
﻿Driver, Work when you like How you work is what you reap, Completely alone when working as well as not working No real Benefits, 
﻿Great Student Experience, Worked for Uber Eats as a delivery partner on my bike. The experience was great because I could work whenever I wanted without being restricted. Payment depends on how much you work. Sometimes you could make around 10 pounds per hour. Weekends are most profitable. You get very fit and you meet a lot of great people., There are times when there are no orders so you just have to sit and wait for an order. Sometimes it can take even an hour. Make sure you work in large urban areas with loads of restaurants and companies.,

You can send up defending your license in the Magistrates..., * clear out local and global management and start again with a strategy and business model that respects workers and the rule of law.

﻿UberEats Delivery Rider/Driver, - This job will certainly get you into tip top condition if you fancy working on you're fitness this job is definitely for you! Although you can use your car scooter or motorbike if you're that way inclined. - Frankly unrivaled flexibility both in terms of hours (you simply turn up and log into the app in the free-login/busiest zones) as well as in terms of work location (access to the rider app gives you the ability..., - Being out and about does mean you will be getting to grips with you're local climate whatever the weather when you work this being said a car has obvious advantages in the winter months. - Next to no oversight from management once you get through the application process which can work in some peoples favor. - As this is pay-per delivery role it will hopefully force you to work smarter as apposed to harder learning..., The only real request I can make to management is to add bike courier insurance including bike theft to the roster of cyclist insurance tailored toward the riders as this can be a real set back for someone who needs their bicycle to work.
﻿Good pay, Work when you want. Great customers., Commission really cuts into earnings., 
﻿Amazing company and fantastic colleagues, - Colleagues are intelligent agile and constantly solving complex problems - Perks such as breakfast lunch socials etc - Interesting projects that keep cities moving - Opportunity to impact on millions of lives - High growth and potential for all colleagues - Inspiring leadership at a local and global level, There are no disadvantages to working for Uber, Keep doing what you are doing
﻿Ubereats Bicycle Delivery, Free to work all day long Can earn as much as you work Driver Customer service is good Got boost payment most of the time Management likes to know about our views, Reducing the boost drastically means very low pay per job Without boost net payment is low per job Waiting time in restaurant long Finding customer location sometimes hard with only postcode Yes we have to ride in rain hot weather winter cold and most importantly on the road with lots of arrogant and unrespectful car drivers., At least customer has to put house number and postcode Net payment per job without boost is too low should be increased In app map location of pick up and delivery both should be shown while requesting riders In town busy areas there could be bike sheds so that riders can stay out of rain or snow.
﻿Operations Manager, This is an exciting growing company, Work-life balance is so so,

﻿Horrendous company, £250 Uber credits and Mac laptop, Sexist backstabbing environment poor pay work 24/7. Hated every minute couldn’t wait to leave, Should not follow how the head office in San Francisco operate. European and American culture are very different
﻿Good if it's busy, , , 
﻿THE WORST COMPANY TO WORK FOR.....LITERALLY MODERN-DAY SLAVERY!!!, Flexibility is the only thing I can think of. You get to meet some interesting people., You earn below minimum wage. You will spend at 12 hours on the roads to make any form of decent money. The company does not care about you in any way. The riders will treat you like you like an empty vessel without a brain because of the reputation of the job as very low paid so why would any one do it. No bonuses or promotions because of the lack of competition. You can get blocked off the app without any warnings....,

﻿FLEXIBLE, I love the fact that they have the option to work the hours you want being a night owl I love to drive late night so it's a perfect system., N/A  I think for now, 
﻿A company with good people working hard to change, Super welcoming intelligent team in the UK office and regionally. Interesting projects great opportunities to learn and develop and to work cross-functionally. Good work-life balance. Lots of chances to take on new responsibilities and roles., Lack of diversity in senior leadership at national regional and international levels; but something they're cognizant of and working hard to address. A lot of stirling individual contributors promoted early to managers leading to good product and project management but weak people management and prof development., 
﻿Mr, It's make me good earning by working with Uber, There is no help by working for Uber While you get accident., 
﻿Once was a great place to work, freedom to create; fast-pace learning, when it gets bigger some political issue show up and few bosses care about development of junior level, please take junior level employees seriously
﻿Expert level 3, Great company to work for name and benefits, Progression is bad they have preferred employees which they promote every 6 months, Get your things together and focus on everyone
﻿It’s ok but vast improvements needed, Work only promo rates and this will reduce how many trips you need to accept. Work between a couple of retailers and build rapport Be smart and not overly casual as many none uk based staff do whist they are over here, If a retailers app is not working but your app shows there is a delivery. You will turn up but won’t get paid. Support only available by email and staff are not trained and more than likely lower paid which you can work out the type that will be filling these positions. Many paid rates are low and therefore more time spent on the road and overall more cost to you. Allot of European people are defrauding the system..., Need to have more support available and irradiate the cowboys from the business and multiple app users . This is having a negative impact on the riders wages who are genuine and your reputation need I mention the temporary licences that have been issued to you !
﻿Uber Delivery Rider, Flexible hours. Exercise while you work., No base pay. Gear was expensive., 
﻿Uber Eats rider vs Deliveroo., After working for Deliveroo for a year I don’t know why I didn’t switch to Uber Eats sooner. There are many positives working with Uber Eats they pay above £4 a drop compared to Deliveroo’s £3.75 a drop. Distances as a cyclist are never more than 10 mins away from restaurants even as short as 5 mins minimal waiting times in restaurants. Uber pay weekly and I can earn anything up to £350 a week for doing half a days work..., Only negatives are McDonald’s ridiculous plastic cup system where they secure drinks and coffees in paper bags and it is almost impossible to get them to the customer intact! I have found that I have needed to request a paper bag with a handle on it in order to keep the drinks intact for the duration of the trips. Also in Romford there is a overflow of riders and sometimes you can be sat around 1-2 hours without an order., Please get McDonald’s to sort their drinks system out it really is frustrating.
﻿UberEats Driver, - Potential to make a good amount of money in a day or over several hours - Nice and fluid app with minimal faults (rarely), - The old black bag can be painful on the spine (avoid) - Could wait for hours and no jobs available, Add value to drivers with perks and meaningful contractual agreements
﻿Flexibility is good Sometimes order are slow!, Flexability Paid on distance not just per delivery App is good Money is good when its busy., Dont get paid when its quite!, 
﻿Driver, If you enjoy driving then this is a great job., Can be long hours and over night stays in hotels from Monday to Friday., Keep up the good work.
﻿Don't Bother, Freedom to work when you want. No boss to answer to. Every day's different, You just don't earn enough after costs unless you want to do a 80 hour week. It's likw working for a robot. You can't speak to anyone on the phone you have to go into one of their centres if you want to speak to a human being., 
﻿Great workplace!, Great people fun working environment and great opportunities to grow, None that come to mind, 
﻿Good culture poor pay and progression opportunities, Intelligent peers good social culture friendly office no severe hierarchy present, Terrible pay progression opportunities are limited by favouritism and/or Global policies,

﻿Flexibility, Long hours High percentage to Uber, Less percentage on fares, 
﻿Private hire driver, As a private hire uber driver you can work flexible shifts, No holiday paid and no sick pay,

﻿Good, Own hours is a great one, Repairs can be costly, 
﻿Courier work at Uber Eats, Flexibility and possibility of earning large amounts if you're willing to work often and at the right time. Good as a part time job, Stress of not knowing how much you'll earn and possibilities of time where you don't earn a lot. Also very boring when done over long periods of time, 
﻿uber driver part time nights, some freedoms around work time, licensing in major cities being removed, 
﻿Best taxi company to drive for., Don’t have to worry that the controller don’t like you and won’t give you jobs. Its all done on the system and it’s fair to everyone. and if you put in the hours you’ll definitely get what you deserve out of it., Too much drivers nowadays but it’s all because everyone knows that Uber is the best in the business and that’s why everyone are leaving private firms and join Uber. ( I wise man once said If you can’t beat them join them), Keep up the good work.
﻿Great Stuff, Really high-energy start-up vibes in a friendly team, Ended up working long hours but I didn't find this negative personally, 
﻿Very Good earnings, Good Rewards and convenient to work with, No cap at number of freelancers, Cap the number of taxi drivers in every city give high rewards to professional drivers.
﻿Uber Eats, Flexibility and ability to earn comparatively more than other 'low-skilled' work., At the mercy of how busy the market is. Can not choose where you would like to operate., Provide delivery drivers with an ability to select "a sector" that they would prefer to work in.
﻿Not bad, Working on your own time so you can be flexible with your hours. It is fulfilling if you like to work long hours, In order to see a decent income you need to work long hours also uber takes 20% of your income which is a significant, cut down the percentage of which you are taking from each lift that way you will be more attractive as a company to fellow drivers.

﻿Great place to work, Enjoy working with brilliant engineers and non-engineers.

﻿Part time job, We all know Uber eats is known by his great work name and trust. that is the reason I want to work and get a great experience. Which will be good for my life experience., Uber does not give any assurance for the job as when you found guilty you will be terminated. there is no interaction with other employees, Make some flexibility interaction with other employees to know each other. nice behavior respect and motivate the employees.
﻿Work whenever, The flexibility is real and never having to answer to anyone. Great pay and can log on and off when any time., No cons here for me nothing other than the fact that London is expensive and end up paying a lot of bills to work here I'd like to try turkey!, If you need a driver please contact me I enjoy driving and would like to live in Turkey
﻿Could be perfect for you depending on your entry point and you goals, - Great fast passed environment - Plenty of opportunity to learn more about the company., - Not much upward mobility. - Difficult to employed directly if you start through a temp agency. - Expectation that you do not want a good work/life balance and that you'll take your work home with you and always be representing the company. - Senior management are not very approachable unless you're a senior member of the team., 
﻿Uber is a good employees to work with, No time limits of working .and work as your own boss., Very low rate of mileage, Increase the mileage rate

﻿Fast paced - you learn a lot, Like minded smart engaged group of people to work with., Long working hours not a lot of defined vertical., Remember that people aren't robots.
﻿UberEATS, Young employees Free food and snacks Social nights in Office Nice new office spaces Faced paced company, Managers who had no managerial experience beforehand who manage a team of 20+ no real progression expected to work as hard as FTE's while being paid very little on a temporary contract no job security constantly being pushed for targets while having no real rewards or even company discounts for using Uber's services. Could be a very political and toxic environment., Push for your team and people who you are supposed to mentor put people in charge who are a little socially aware. Offer a staff discount to contract workers - it's not a big ask to help bring the divide of FTE's to Contract down and offer an even playing ground.
﻿Ok, Pick your own shifts good if you enjoy cycling, Don't earn much when its not busy, 
﻿EXCELLENT, Fun Fast paced exciting Cool, A con would be that because it's so new there are questions of its stability but that would be the only thing, 
﻿Slave Labour, Do double the hour to make same money as local companies, Charge decent fares there's no need to abuse drivers, 
﻿Deliveroo is much more organised and proper, Flexible work hours. depends on you., Terribly managed. Have frequent miscommunications with the company when their support desk tells me that customer made a mistake and to mark a job as cancelled so that she won't be charged for her double order. I was told that I will get paid as well. In the end I was told that because the job was not completed I was not entitled to the bonuses that they offer for completing a certain number of jobs. This is just one..., Shape up your rider support operations and induction programme.

﻿BDR, Incredibly exciting place to work., The public have a misconstrued perception of Uber which means I constantly have to defend the company., 
﻿You can make £100+ a day if you really serious on doing deliveries., You can start and end anytime. that's the only pro!, The pay is rubbish so you have to do more deliveries. £4 is minimum you can make per delivery. You don't get tips at all which Isn't fair for example I did a delivery when it was raining down like crazy and all I got was £4.50! Sometimes one or two people will give you a cash tip and I'll say thank you very much. Even though uber says don't take it! The uber navigation is the worst in the world I always end up somewhere..., Please treat us like humans and stop sending me far for little money!!!!
﻿Driver, Can work when you want and is easy if you haven't worked in this field before. Easy to use app, Is a terrible company when it comes to looking after drivers. It also pays very little for a lot of work., Respect your drivers and limit the commission Uber takes.

﻿Fantastic Company to work for!, Incredible employee benefits at a corporate level. Including free breakfasts lunches and MUCH much more - not forgetting free gear! All the staff from junior to senior are extremely friendly and do some incredible work. A genuinely great place to work - second to none.

﻿Driver, Work when you want to., Low pay rates and very long hours after expenses very little left over., Give the workers more rights. Complete all checks before you make people start and spend money on insurance vehicles and equipment and then only to tell them their contract is cancelled.
﻿below minimum wage, Meeting people from different backgrounds and many different places who can be very interesting You can start and finish when you want to, Extremely low pay Example 60 hours get 600 pounds which seems a lot but take out the taxi rental and fuel that's nearly three fifty less Leaving two hundred and fifty pounds for sixty hours work Buy a car not much difference to rental as you have repair bills insurance and lose money when off road plus cost of buying and replacing car cost of mot etc etc, You guys will never do it as that's why uber is so successful but we need higher fares And 25% out of our earnings is way too high Customers think fares are low they should see what we get !
﻿Challenging interesting but makes people super tired, I was given opportunities to do all the things that I want to do., Everyone worked overtime everyday here., 
﻿Driver, You can do the job part or full time also you don't get any runners because it all paid on the app., The fares could be a little higher you have to count on the surge pricing to make any money, Fares need to go up to a reasonable price!
﻿Uber Expert, Wonderful work atmosphere there's plenty going on socially too! You'll find everyone in the company is happy to help you out if you drop them an e-mail. Excellent perks too with free UBER rides each month and a generous expenses program., The occasional late night or overnight but apart from that I've found this job to be extremely fun and equally rewarding. Understandably you'd need to be flexible within this role to shine. Your monthly calendar will involve at least two weekday nights away from home., 
﻿Mixed bag lots of perks but superficial support from managers., Perks such as free food were fantastic. Managers were initially very supportive., Saw a lot of stuff get "stuck" in dead end projects with no future. This led to no prospect of promotion since future with the company is dependent upon success of projects., It is kind of odd how all support immediately evaporated when you raised relevant concerns for example watehousing safety.
﻿Great place, Great to learn and develop, Could pay better salary and benefits, 
﻿Driver, You cannot find such a flexible job anywhere else. The money is great. More hours one put in more money they will make. You are in full control of your earnings., Fares are very low considering Uber's share., Uber's 25% deduction needs to be looked into considering the fares are very low.
﻿uber driver, traffic is bad man trust me, pay more, 
﻿No hourly pay, work when you want where you want. it's easy to use the app and really has no hassle..., they recently removed hourly pay in a bid to introduce "boost" which gives a multiplier on your fare in certain busier areas. yet I have been online for 5hours and received only 1 order giving me £4.91 which means I have worked for £0.98 per hour whereas the minimum wage for my age (18-20) is £5.60 that's a huge gap. I don't think I'll be working with ubereats again unless they reimburse my pay and reintroduce hourly..., 
﻿Uber have a lot of management issues and give out false information to wannabe drivers, Your your own boss.. that's all, Worked with this outfit since July 16. They put me into debt by 15k by telling me to purchase a vehicle under 8 years old. Only to find TFL won't licence vehicles over 5years old. I bought a 6 year old car. Then it was suggested to redo my private hire licence through another borough whom would licence vehicles upto 7years old which I did. It took 7 months to get licensed. When emailing them you never get to communicate..., Communication with your partners needs increasing tenfold. Check UK legislation and local authority rules before allowing Uber support staff to dish out poor mislead information Increase rider rates to help your partners earn some decent salaries Market the business better in the home counties so that there is enough work to go round before partners leave and go elsewhere leaving the riders to believe that...
﻿Partnership Representative, Free food and snacks Nice kitchen, Being micro managed by managers BIG gap between managers and sales reps. All sales reps on contract roles high turnover of staff., Treat partnership reps as adults.
﻿Investigator, Full of hard working dedicated individuals. No matter where you turn you will find people committing to helping others and in turn the business., It's busy. To some this may be a con but you need to accept that you will be working hard potentially long hours. You need the right attitude as you will need to hit the ground running!, Carry on. We are a startup but you are making the correct moves in further the company both externally and internally.
﻿Marketing manager, Everyone is clear on the company goal and mission. Lots of opportunity to run/lead projects because of how much is happening at all times., beauracratic unorganized not any resources available. You'll learn more here in 6 months than you would at any other job for a year., 
﻿GM, Great culture and autonomy to grow, High pressured environment that can often be relentless, 
﻿Great place to work., Intelligent forward thinking colleagues. Great Perks. Good career progression options., Salary isn't super competitive. You can feel left in the dark during the recruitment process., Improvements already being made to on boarding (recruitment) Make sure you signpost candidates at every step of the process.
﻿London PCO Driver, I absolutely won't advise anyone to join uber as a driver due to unfair treatment, There's no driver support team and easily can dismiss the driver due to unfair ratings and reviews I have had many issues since I started with uber and they never ever helped They use us as a machine although we are their first customer before even the riders Once a drunk girl broke my car rear armrest and once a rider vomited in my car and once a couple opened the door hard and hits other car which caused damage..., Needs to update the maps correctly Need a drivers support team ( real teams) Needs to consider unfair ratings and reviews left by riders New management maybe will improve Fares Totally it's a rubbish however if you use it as a secondary company maybe ok
﻿Great for the CV but that's about it., Uber credits and lunch budget, They do think "awesome working environment" comes as part of the perks however it only goes downhill from there. You do not get recognition no one cares about the individuals and team work it's more of a everyone fends for themselves kind of culture. Very bias and unless you are friends with your managers you really cannot get anywhere., Train managers to be managers not just wait and hope that they can do it.
﻿Driver, Flexible hours to suit your lifestyle Improving platform and an increase in the number of passengers mean a decent income can be achieved, Can be long hours and favours passengers more than drivers, Improve driver relationships quicker Listening alone without rewarding or improving the facilities is not good enough
﻿Honestly the WORST company I've ever worked for, -they love to throw money at the problem so there are free lunch allowances as well as lots of 'team bonding' nights etc, - sexist - unprofessional - ridiculously unqualified males in management positions - a culture of making people in lower positions feel replaceable and unimportant, Restructure the entire organisation especially management.
﻿Work Life, Flexibility and easy environment great colleagues career progression and great management., Unpredictable tasking be prepared to work to tight deadlines, 
﻿PCO driver, , , 
﻿Poor Support, I wouldn't recommend working for them if you can help it. You are just another number with them and no more., Poor pay higher hours bad support. Always expecting you to go the extra mile for the customer whilst they take 25% of you and then invest it in autonomous car projects to replace you in the future. The company CEO's behaviour and attitude is disgraceful., Find another company to work for because the ride hailing bubble will burst. Uber are struggling and hemorrhaging a lot of investor capital whilst paying back no tax. Local and national companies will eventually ease back into this sector.
﻿Decent but could be better, It took a long time to make a decent amount of profit considering rent pay insurance and fuel., use surge pricing more frequently, 
﻿Don't work for this company, Nothing good anymore in this job, You have to work under minimum wage with your own car fuel and insurance, 
﻿Okay, A very Nice building and food with a forward thinking team. You're given a lot of freedom. New team members constantly, Your usually working long hours. There is lots of segregation between full time employees and temp staff. If you are a temp staff you will be treated like one, 
﻿Poor organisation, Work when you want. Pay weekly No boss Very quick to start - a couple of weeks max Great flexible job for student. Incentivised periods offer increased earnings, Poor pay scheme (per delivery not per hour) means you could earn £1/h sometimes as I have in the past in central SOHO during 'busy' weekend periods. Safety is a concern especially in the dark winter months. The restaurant is sometimes a 20-25 minute journey away from your position meaning you can earn a maximum of about a fiver per hour although on a good time if you hit the incentivised requirements you can make..., Don't just copy Deliveroo step for step otherwise you will gain an equal share in the market improve your work benefits to draw employees from them. Don't treat your employees like crap by reducing their pay unannounced.
﻿Operations Coordinator, - Always busy - Hustle required at start up - Great interactions with driver partners, - Can have limited room for growth - Salary not competitive in the market - Incredibly stressful, 
﻿Inspired by Pace & Ambition, Never have I experienced a company with such ambition to change at pace with of course the people in place to realize it. It's an inspiring place to come to work every day and there are real efforts to keep the business fresh and steer clear of the pitfalls experienced by corporations of this size., High pressure high expectations incredibly talented peer - it can be difficult to stand out but the collective achievement and shared credit means this isn't actually so bad., Be wary of the pitfalls of large corporations bureaucracy impersonal relationships etc.
﻿Driver, U can choose what hours u work, No good company they don't care about drivers, 
﻿Operations & Logistics Manager, Sharp humble colleagues great work environment very proactive and ever changing career and responsibilities great opportunities to grow and evolve and work abroad., Salary is at the very bottom range of the skill set and market rates for the competence that people have here., 
﻿Uber Motivation, Flexible working hours are great., Lack of driver coaching leads to poor performance., Hire a trainer/motivator
﻿uber, - developing company - many orders (if you are willing to work a lot) - possibility of interaction with clients and other drivers - sense of start-up, - could be better paid - in some cities licence for taxi is needed, 
﻿Ubereats delivery, You can work whenever you want. You are your own boss., Poor money compare to conditions you have to work in. No carrier progress. No benefits., You should appreciate good couriers by some benefits. Follow the ratings and trips per hours.
﻿Self employment, , , 
﻿Do not work for uber eats, Nice alert for jobs and a good concept however the delivery drivers lose out in false incentives that are not delivered, They give false promises of incentives then do not deliver and when questioned they deny all knowledge and you from pillar to post only to receive minimal payout, Help the small people do not give false promises and rob you of incentives that are not delivered
﻿Driving for uber, Nothing good about uber if you are working as a driver, Very cheapmodern day slaveryworse company, Increase the prices
﻿AMAZING COMPANY, Everything was perfect. I loved the team., Lack of communication in some situations., 
﻿Learnt more in the last 4 months than years in consulting, Incredible learning curve. I've learnt more in the last 4 months than many years in consulting. I work with intelligent hardworking motivated and very fun colleagues. Putting aside the great brand name and the equity the real standout feature of working at Uber has been the incredible and supportive culture. It is like nothing I've ever experienced before., Poor work-life balance - employees really need to work long and hard hours to achieve what is expected (hours are beyond anything I have seen or experienced from consulting banking or other demanding industries)., More recognition of the hard work delivered by employees.
﻿Great hiring process excellent company, - very collaborative culture - super smart people - they GENUINELY want to get things done and if you have a good idea the next week it will be implemented - the recruitment process is super lean within a couple of weeks you know whether you got the job or not - they value individuals so you can wear whatever you feel most comfortable in, Everyone is so motivated that the work hours are per default not a 9 to 5. If this is nothing for you then definitely don't join the company, As
﻿They don't care their drivers, Flexibility. You can work anytime you want and as little or more as you want. Easy enrolment process. They'll help you getting a PH Licence, Company doesn't support drivers. You have to work extremely long hours to earn a living. Fares are too low and after they take their 25% commission and deduct your expenses you're probably better off stacking shelves on a pound shop. No support or help to drivers. I don't trust them. I have a small accident and I have reported it just to keep them in the picture and that was mistake. They "back stabbed" me by deactivating..., Care about drivers.
﻿need to value their partners more, very flexible and independent, bad communication between partners and Uber, change ways of interacting with your partners feel just like a rider.
﻿Not so good, The pay is good., There are hardly any jobs. You could literally wait around for 2-3 hours and not get any jobs., Provide suggested areas that are popular etc.
﻿Quite an experience!, good solid pay long hours cool customers and a quick way to learn your way around the city!, fuel expenses are large sometime could eat into your profit margin. wear and tear on the car could cost a lot!, increase the speed at which you respond to customer complaints sometimes the rider could really be abusive if you do not treat them like royalty.
﻿Uber Brand Amabassador, Working as a brand ambassador was rewarding Uber paid a £10 commission for every driver recruited £70 for every driver activated really easy work., Communication with managers was difficult and slow earnings were usually paid late., 
﻿Uber- it is a faced paced ride!, Things get done really quickly at Uber. It's not about how pretty your presentation slides look but the quality of the plan on it- and then as soon as the meeting ends it's time to get executing on it! Really energetic colleagues who are passionate about making a difference., It's hard not to get so absorbed in the company  that you think about how to make things better all the time!, It's such a great company  with great values it will be important to keep the bar high when it comes to recruiting so our culture scales with out growth.
﻿Very disorganised London office terrible PSR management, Uber provide Free breakfast lunch and snacks room for progression Great employees great work life balance and overall and pleasant environment to work in., Terrible management absolutely rubbish training underpaid for what PSR staff do a company that's more so about what you look like rather than your ability to do the job fake personas don't apply if you're introverted., My advice to management would be to learn how to manage and assess your staff properly as at the moment you do an awful job at analysing staff performance and accurately judging who is great at their job and who isn't.
﻿Driver Partner, Flexibility you work when and how long you work, Loads of additional costs decreasing hourly pay, Increase prices
﻿Great while it lasts, A great young and excited team full of like-minded people, Micro-management inexperienced management no progression poor pay with no chance of real increase, 
﻿Customer service, Central office that's it pretty much, Hours office drivers managers, Come down to the real worl
﻿Excellent. Quck and fine to apply to, Friendly people and can interact with many other people in all other types of industries, Very difficult to get into if you ate new without any sort or form of xpwriwmce in tue job your applying to., Go to other companies to gain more expwrience. It will look good on type CV
﻿Great!, , , 
﻿Driver, Great placet work meet new peoples, More hours you work to make smart money, 
﻿Pretty Bleak ...... Unless you feel an 80 hour week is normal, In the beginning it was very good lots of intelligent and rather pleasant people to pick up. Time management is your own, Poor rates of pay Uber constantly tipping the scales towards their own needs Long long hours Customer is always right even when they blatantly wrong Ever decreasing rates of pay Always more and more "partner" drivers to compete with. Disparity between drivers and commission scales Inflexibility at times to suit your own pattern of work, Employ people with transport and industry knowledge not leave everything to a computer or algorithm
﻿XDA deposit, Was good. But now they are just greedy for their money. No good words for them.go to hell, They don't give a tuss about drivers. I paid £150 for XDA deposit but when I gave them XDA back they return £74.50. They are robbing drivers in day light., You greedy people learn how to respect your drivers.
﻿I love Uber - but crazy hours!, I work with the most intelligent fun interesting colleagues I love what I do and I feel very invested in our mission!, I work all the time and it never ends! I rarely leave before 8pm and always have a bit to do on the weekends. It feels like I can never quite catch up - but at the same time I love it so it's cool :), PAY ME BY THE HOUR!
﻿Temping, , , 
﻿Hard job for few pounds, You must be really desperate or a refugee., 14 - 15 hours per day to make 100 or 120 pound a day after Uber take its share. On that money you still have to pay your taxes - petrol - insurance... You are better off workink at MC Donalds., 
﻿London Ops Mgr, Great culture amazing people good perks, Hard work but worth it, 
﻿so called uber partner, Your time your earnings, No support for drivers which are called partners. No responsibility accepted by management., My Uber device logged me out. Lost £50 fare due app stopped working. Then could not work for 4 days of long weekend. Uber accepted mistake but tough luck app didn't work no compensation for on their system failure.
﻿Not good for Drivers, I`m working with company just under a 1 year. I`m own boss  weekend is good work  more you work more you earn., Fare was £1.75 and its getting low and low(£1.25+20p min). Its good for Customer but not for drivers., company just look for their driver numbers. Drivers don't get looked after. There is no training. messed up with london with 10-15 k drivers. Changing rules everyday like changing clothes. company people have not have any idea that whats going on on roads.
﻿One of the best, - Some of the smartest people that you will ever work with - Interesting problems to solve every day many of which the world has never solved before - Incredible benefits, - Some structural and organizational changes due to the ever-changing nature of the business. I'm sure that this will calm down a bit as the company matures as a public company., 
﻿Hard work, There is a really well developed customer base in Chicago. So it's easy to get trips., In 19 months I've worked late nights (400+ trips) and I've worked mid days. I've worked weekends and I've worked weekdays. There is a difference in what you can make. It takes experimentation to determine how to maximize your profits. Another hard thing is that Uber doesn't pay consistently. I started in January 2018. Since that time the fair I get paid has experienced change 5 different times. Every time they..., Figure out how you are going to pay your drivers and stay consistent.
﻿OK, , , 
﻿GREAT FOR SELF, If you enjoy being independent as well as driving vast distances this is a job for you., There is little to no management to complain too.

﻿Great Company for young professionals, Competitive Salary and Benefits clearly defined career progression paths with easy mobility to other departments within your branch and opportunities to transfer abroad. Collaborative environment filled with interesting hand picked colleagues health insurance there is lots more off course but pretty good place to work., Uber is relatively young fast moving and now publicly traded company so change is something you have to be prepared for. Hours of work and shift patterns can be challenging for some too.,

﻿Excellent Learning for INterns, Extremely Friendly and Humble people with an excellent company culture, As an Intern cannot find any fault with the company, 
﻿Community Operations Manager, Culture Career growth Flexibility Flat Hierarchy and Helpful peers & Managers, Office politics favouritism are two cons I can think of, Remove favouritism and bias
﻿Exciting challenges, Uber is changing the way cities move and with that comes exciting challenges new opportunities and above all an eagerness to improve., Uber has grown significantly in the past few years and with that comes growing pains that are challenging - mainly in the org structure and ways of working., 
﻿Driving for others, Serving others to move around the city, I have to work hard and make a lot hours for more money, Nothing at the moment

﻿Great place to work, 1. Scale and growth 2. Work-life balance., 1. The company slowed down after 2017 incident., 
﻿So glad I chose Uber, - Hiring process: very fast I got an offer in the same week as my interview and from there it was just a matter of when I want to join - Revamped culture: I don't see any signs of what I use to hear in the media about the bad culture. I see the whole company pushing the new norms and focusing on diversity and inclusion - The mission: Uber has a great potential to letterly move the world - Talent in the company: I'm..., - Uber is doing so much and joining from a startup company was a bit overwhelming - Hearing and seeing people leave the company (which is very normal for companies at this size and age) was a little hard for a new hire such as me, 
﻿DON'T TRUST THEIR INSURANCE!, Meeting good people! Getting a break to take care of personal business., Your vehicle isn't covered if involved in an accident! Even if they tell you your car is covered. So sad they don't care about their employees and or their belongings., Don't treat the people that help your business run like trash! We are all here to help each other. Don't sell insurance and not cover your drivers.
﻿Cordinator at Uber Tech Canada, -Company Culture is great. -Friendly people. -Empowers their employee to work independently., - I haven't located any yet, 
﻿Good Side Hustle, Set your own hours select your own route, If you don't like to hustle for your income you will not be satisfied with this gig., 
﻿Good experience, , , 
﻿Good if you need money... drive smart ... they cut rates again, Money if you need it. You can work when you want to. Make sure you do your deductions on taxes., To make money now for UberX you have to drive so many hours. Unhealthy and unsafe how many drivers 12-14 hours a day. The bonuses are absolutely terrible now since the company went public. Driving at busy surging times only now., Driver support needs training bad. Forget about sending in emails for driver support most often they don’t answer the questions or resolve the problem. Streams of email threads to get a situation resolved. All of a sudden you get a different person who asks the same thing over again you tell them to look at the email thread. It’s terrible. End up just dropping it because they don’t know or do it on purpose. Seemingly...
﻿Thankful for the Opportunity, Opportunity to build and innovate; fast growth/promotion opportunities; flexibility to work from home; positive culture; people are mission driven; global company with the start up culture feel; intelligent colleagues;, Compensation work life-balance and quality of food which I have found not be the greatest (pink chicken not good) is an area of opportunity., Consider raising/evaluating the compensation on Recruiters we are severely underpaid compared to our counterparts in other companies.
﻿Operations Intern, Got to learn a lot of things., There are none the team I worked with was really cool., 
﻿Broker, You get total freedom to get your job done the way you want! Uber gives you all the tools to succeed (veteran desk mates brand new lap top solid managers free free etc) it is just up to you to prioritize your day. Starting out as a Ops Coordinator you have minimal responsibilities but I advise you to over book so your leads can see you can do the job!, Pay. The starting salary isn't bad but after you start over booking loads and see you book more loads than some of the higher ups you are going to want more money., Keep being lenient. More works gets done when you grant your workers autonomy. You all are doing a great job!

﻿Business analyst, Work life balance is not so good, Waste of time in spending your valuable time! They make you wait all time and leave you unselected even though you have done well in interview, Please makes interviews more ordered
﻿N/A, , , 
﻿Worst internal politics I have ever seen, The majority of team members are very skilled kind and very good to work with., Some of the directors and managers I worked with have bad relationship with superiors/subordinates and they let any pressure or negative feedback go through to the people reporting to them without taking any responsibility., Managers should take responsibility for their own decisions. When managers ask engineers who report to them to do some work on projects in a specific directions managers should not come back and blame the engineers for not doing other things.
﻿Restaurant operations Consultant - Key Accounts Manager, Almost a 7 day work week, Hire more people, 
﻿Uber eats driver experience, I can work anytime its flexible, Driver support is poor took too long to approve account pay is very low no request in hours. Sometimes i made $8 per hour., Improve driver support

﻿Uber eats platform, Nice interface smooth pick-up and drop-off, Cancellations without notice removal of instant pay without notice as well, Have better customer support as far as the fleetside I better communication with your drivers instead of just doing something
﻿Flexible but risky, Flexible hours and you set your own ceiling, Must hold your own taxes no retirement., None
﻿I am in charge of everything, There was never a dull moment, Getting paid could take long, Suck it
﻿Good not great., companionship; "help each other" spirit within CSRs; free vending machines; job is not rocket science; reasonable pay given the role; nice office location., some incompetent/unprofessional lower and middle management; lack of structured communication and business processes; poor IT and HR., go back to the drawing board.
﻿40k is not accurate . Roughly 12 an hour at bad times and 15 at its best, It’s nice to have free time and choose ur own work hours, Too many drivers not enough people needing rides plus everyone is a Uber driver today u can look around and identify 30 drivers within a block most of whom aren’t from Missouri and creep over from neighboring Illinois to steal our business, Get it together stop letting people without even a/c pick up ur passengers or donut tires it broke down cars maybe stop letting drug addicts in seriously
﻿Central Operations Consultant, Company Culture is really nice., Full-time Employees can make you feel unwanted at times., 
﻿It is a great way to earn extra money along with studying or full-time job, Flexibility is the strongest weapon for Uber. You can go online anytime you want and earn some extra pocket money. Uber is a real deal for anyone who needs money or enjoys driving with interacting with customers., You must have or lease a car to start Uber. Also you may meet some unpredicted and unpleasant situation while you are doing Uber. In that situation you should keep a professional attitude., Safety is the priority. Driving is one of the risky actions in human life.

﻿Great company to work for!, Competitive salary and compensation very generous perks (amazing maternity/paternity leave health benefits opportunities to invest in your career). Meaningful work that touches millions of people's lives every day., Hours/amount of work can sometimes be overwhelming. Nothing crazy but just slightly more than preferred at times., Continue to listen to employees!
﻿My Review, Making my own schedule is very convenient, Every now and then you get a customer that will rate before they even enter the vehicle., Offer an incentive to tip your drivers.
﻿Learn and build network with outstanding employees before being discarded, Great people with outstading knowledge set an environment of learning and pushing to new techniques., Poor management coming from Executive Leadership Team Lack of Transparency Disposable Employees Uber sells itself as super cool but it's far away from it, They won't listen ... won't lose my time
﻿Good leadership hard market, Good leadership turnaround from Dara. Love the company's general treatment of employees., It's a low margin market and any new player with money can basically force all players to drop their margins and go all in with the price-war.,

﻿Do not take up contractual role at Uber, Uber has an amazing work culture and amazing benefits for employees. The work life balance is good too. Got to interact with various teams while working on projects., 1. My biggest issue was being a contractor at Uber. Major discrimination between EXTs and FTs. 2. Managers are FTs and therefore care little about the EXTs. At least my manager seemed to be too self centred and abandoned the team completely. 3. There is no hierarchy or growth structure for EXTs making it a stagnant job with an unclear career path. 4. Contractors have zero communication with top management so no..., 
﻿Get your own dang food!, * being able to work at anytime * some tip, * waiting * wasting gas time * a lot of wear and tear * some tip, * make tip a mandatory
﻿Hardworking company changing the way people get around, free lunch great people you get to do so much outside of your role because despite size Uber is still working hard and hungry to succeed. The greatest job I’ve ever had with lots of growth and opportunities for my hard work, Management at times lacks skills needed to be a manager because they started so young/moved up quickly in the company, 
﻿You're in Control, , , 
﻿Flexibility, , , 
﻿Working at Uber is incredible, It's very fun multicultural has free food and snacks there a lot team bonding activities has a good workbalance, It's really difficult to ask for courses that are not imparted by the company. Doesn't have a graduate program, 
﻿horrible, I hate all of it, no cons I absolutely did not like it, 
﻿Not Bad For Extra Cash, , ,

﻿Seems legit starting soon., Make my own schedule working part time., Not sure yet. But I'll update soon., Na
﻿PM, Cool way to go place in a nice area, Coolness is not in the uber vocabulary, 
﻿Way too fast paced and employees get burnt out, - benefits are good - many opportunities to make impact and fast track your career growth, - Way too fast paced - very rushed culture to continuously try to make impact - need to continually push oneself and burn out common within 2 years - too much emphasis on moving faster all the time instead of doing things a bit more slowly and carefully - management and priorities constantly changing - managers do not have much experience and training, - focus on key priorities - protect your reports instead of having them fend for themselves - hire competent and focused leaders if you want to move this fast - provide better training for leadership
﻿good company good as a part time gig, flexible schedule you choose your own schedule and you are your own boss, no benefits even if you do it part time uber does not give any kind of benefits, 
﻿Highlights, Make your own hours, Sometimes hours no call no hourly compensation, Add hourly compensation when 30min or more
﻿Abysmal support, Nothing. Website was easy to create an account on? That's it I guess., Terrible support website forces you through endless menus that are irrelevant to the issue at hand no email no telephone useless. Was texted by someone(???) in support who then promptly never responded to text replies. ABYSMAL support., Give people the means to actually find a telephone number or an email when their problems aren't answered by the generic menu.
﻿Their class action lawsuit on behalf of all women and minorities speaks for itself, The food is not bad., Rampant sexual harassment and a wildly disorganized duplication of work and conflicting goals at every level of the organization, Do better
﻿Good and fun college money maker, Easy and can work at your own schedule, Gas money starts to add up, 
﻿an alright side gig, Flexible and Decent side money, Very annoying how inconsistent the money could be. It mostly depends on the city that you drive in however., Please raise the bonuses as incentives for drivers.
﻿Great job, Choose your own hours, Nothing really to complain about, 
﻿I drive uber daily, Lack of customers sometimes but still earn 7000 a day, Increase of salary, 
﻿fast growing taxi, easy to manage your own time, sometimes the maintenance of your car so expensive and the business so slow now days, pay more for long pickup mountain area and long drop off
﻿community operations specialist, Professional service and good way to explore things. Employment friendly., Dispute in drivers and riders, 
﻿Best of both worlds: start-up mindset and global impact, Although Uber is now a public global company with thousands of engineers and employees there's still a start-up mentality in which you have lots of autonomy can move fast and question the status-quo. The internal culture is extremely healthy with high energy and very intelligent people all around. The office in São Paulo is amazing and the food is great., There are really no major downsides to join the new São Paulo Tech Center office for engineers looking to make a difference., 
﻿Great company with great benefits, * Interesting work no two days are alike * Ability to drive projects forward and make your mark on a high growth company * Strong pay and benefits, * Potential for long hours working with colleagues in different time zones * Ability to set your own schedule lends to working longer hours, 
﻿Great Company and Supportive Culture, - Great and Caring Management - Helpful resources to grow your career - Lots of opportunities to mature the company and build out new processes, - Workload can be overwhelming - Need to have the personality and persistence to work at this company - Spend too much time planning - Management can be too busy, Focus less on politics and more on planning/executive
﻿Toxic, Everything this was the worst place I have ever worked., Go away., 
﻿Full time job, I want to do job in uber company because i have heard so much about Uber company. Uber company is the fastest growing company in the market and Uber company also provide good facilities for the employee. Thats why i want to do job in uber, I personally dont think that there is any downsides in working with Uber company, Keep up the good work
﻿Good role, Perks like free uber credits, not a friendly atmosphere at, 
﻿Great Atmosphere, Management is always there for help., Workload can be tensed during peak hours., 
﻿Territory Lead Central and South Spain, , , 
﻿Good for the first year and a half..., Flexible Schedule Meet New People Travel Bonuses, Time Consuming Saturated Driver Market Complicated Bonuses at times Wear and Tear on your personal Viechle, The first year and a half was pretty good then the diver's market became very saturated and bonuses became less and less and some hard to attain. Hours became longer while driving and doing the service while pay was lowering.
﻿Fantastic Place to Work, The people are understanding and helpful. The perks (lunch is provided snacks and drinks are always available benefits and PTO are top notch). The job itself is also fulfilling., The job can be time consuming but not to an extreme., Keep it up and feel free to give me a raise. ;)
﻿Great Job, The pay benefits and off on Sundays, Uber takes care of their worker. No cons, keep up the good work
﻿Great place to work, , , 
﻿Awesome Opportunities, Free Food Open Culture Awesome opportunities to establish processes, Cant think of any yet, 
﻿Sales Support Expert, Part-time Teamwork Training great work environment., Lack of communication with the back office., Ask for more dedication from your employers.
﻿Responsive Company, UBER was always open to new ideas on how to make the experience for employees and customers more pleasant. They responded quickly to issues and implemented great ideas., The Greenlight Hubs were not always open when needed., 
﻿It’s as positive as you make it., , , 
﻿Good company to work for, instant pay meeting new people driving Seeing different areas good partner phone/chat support, long hours no health benefits PPT benefeits glitchy app You are technically a contractor for uber but there should be reforms to allow benefits for drivers. This contractor relationship allows uber to take advantage of drivers uber commission is not transparent enough, give benefits to drivers
﻿It was ok, , , 
﻿Awesome culture and strong engineering, Awesome culture excellent WLB strong engineering with lots of interesting issues to solve for our users and for our internal teams., Rest-and-vest behavior for lots of senior employees process for performance/promotion very inefficient lots of inexperienced managers., 
﻿Dependable, The opportunity to meet new people, Miles on new car and the damages, N/A
﻿Dead End Job, a lot of free time to do what you want and when, maintenance wear and tear belligerent people, none no future for your self to advance anywhere dead end job
﻿Great way to supplement income, Work when you want as much or as little as you want., Waiting for deliveries sometimes it was only worth working during lunch and dinner times, Keep up the incentive pay and tips feature is great!
﻿The best company.. no doubt about it.., So much of learning opportunities. You can find many good boss who can literally take your career to whole new level (your ideas and involvement matters). Do even think twice. If you get a chance join here.i regret for leaving the organization as if was too good in hearing the ideas and implementing it which you won't be able to find it anywhere else., The external and internal payroll difference is kind of playing politics and hurting people sentiments., You are doing great pelase continue. If possible please rethink about the external payroll policy keeping people sentiments in to consideration try to get everyone under one roof.
﻿Great Place to Work, Really great community of people here at Uber. Everyone is very smart thoughtful and accepting here which is amazing. From day one your voice is heard and your opinion is taken into consideration. The work life balance is amazing. Management here truly understands that there is a life outside work - And they encourage you to live it. The unlimited paid time off is actually used - No one ever gives you a hard time for..., For this role as a recruiter - It's a hard job. Just trying to help people to understand that this is a great place to work can be a challenge. Also the technical bar expected for hiring of engineers is high., 
﻿good, easy schedule with college and family, alot of traffic tickets and traffic, 
﻿Worst company ever, No pros working in this company, Worst conpany. No work life balance. And they ask you to resign after and and half year in the name of costcutting., 
﻿Account Executive for Uber Eats, Exiting Flexibility Technology Youngness Big bold Bets Perseverance, Management Transparency Guidelines Salary Employees structure HR structure,

﻿Eh it’s okay, Wear and tear on car Gas Too many drivers not enough orders, Pay per mile, 
﻿Didn't work there long- pay isn't worth it, , , 
﻿Finally! A company I feel I'm a great match for., One of the core pillars the Executive Leadership Team focuses on is Employee Retention. I've never experienced that before. They spend a lot of effort working on ways to keep employees happy engaged and recognized., Some groups are not part of the core Rideshare teams and are as such semi-isolated by communications and initiatives. But to be fair it's a huge global company., 
﻿., , , 
﻿Sad place to work!, Free lunch free snacks Uber credits, Low pay no 401k match depreciation of equity unfair treatment/favoritism not very LGBTQ friendly in Chicago long hours etc., 
﻿Worst, When it come to fix your money u earn no problem so far., This company is the worst as a driver we have no precaution. They goes along with anything the riders comment are say about u without investigation if it's the truth or not before they post it on your drivers app. They really needing to look into those things because drivers are so not happy and they are going to start losing us..it may seems impossible but just wait an see..really not happy with this company...., Please Management really need to look into to this matter because drivers are not happy working for you guys at this moment. Get a team to really look into things before posting them to the drivers app some is true but most of it is all lie. Not because the riders maybe having a bad day they just feel like saying anything on the app that's not true. Like the other day I picked up a rider and they saw that i supported...
﻿MANILA COE - business obsessed not customer obsessed, Unlimited snacks Free lunch Wellbeing allowance, From the team leader to the higher ups they don’t care for their employees. Everything is just a show off. They encourage people to VOICE out their concerns yet no action is taken! I filed an incident report to HR but nothing happened even after asking for a follow up. In MANILA COE you don’t have a voice. Your youth will be wasted working for a selfish management-centered company. If you’re young try to improve..., Take down all your hypocrite team leaders. They ask us to work yet let other employees slack off (because they’re friends). Those kind of team leads doesn’t deserve to be trusted nor respected. Always listen to your employees. Don’t make them a corporate slave!
﻿Hard on your car, Work when you like. Easy hiring process., High maintenance cost low appreciation from the organization, Consider how much maintenance cost is for a vehicle. There should not be one mile not accounted for as far as to pay! Consider the price of gas as well
﻿its a job for extra money its not for making a living, Make as much money as hours you want to work, you dont have any guaranteed, 
﻿A chance to be your own boss?, Every day is different. I have met fascinating people from 27 different countries. The opportunity to set your own schedule is a fantastic benefit., Uber doesn't care about their drivers. They know there is always someone to replace you. While the CEO made $50 million last year. I averaged $9 per hour in the car fuel expenses. There are to many drivers resulting in low ride counts., Stop treating your driver's like the are a commodity they are real people trying to make a living. Uber rates are one third of taxi rates in our city. Plus there is no incentive to become a lot by term driver. A driver starting today and make more than I do after nearly three years.
﻿Karma bites, Part time ability Nothing else as the company lacks integrity and empathy, Too many to list see below, Karma sucks eh? Love watching the stock burn and all the employees dreams being crushed. Sorry they cut out your birthday balloons! That must suck. Have they cut your pay yet? Have they eliminated your benefits yet? No your not at quite the low level as drivers yet. At least they are laying off people! I don’t feel bad because now they can drive for a living see how the backbone lives. I hope you are scared...
﻿Ehhh., You can set your own schedule, Everything else. Especially treatment by company., 
﻿A silicon-valley company mistaken for a taxi company, Incredible network. You'll instantly have access to tons of high-caliber people around the world with all sorts of backgrounds. It's very much like gaining another top-MBA network. And what's best is they all want to collaborate! It's a startup environment but safer and with enough corporate flair. You'll have a lot of opportunities to distinguish yourself and grow vertically and horizontally., If you're good enough but in it solely for the money then you're at the wrong address. The process from application to hire/onboarding is really long but it ensures your colleagues are strong enough to fit in. Depending on country there's a stigma "working for Uber" that you're working for a taxi company. You should be strong enough to bear that though., 
﻿Uber experience (part-time doable), Not many orders/riders Way too many drivers on the road Way too much traffic Rush hour gets even crazier Longer rides less pay not worth it Express Pool very unsafe and confusing Most pickup points and dropoff address are at non stopping zones or passenger standing right on the bicycle lane Travelling far? Good but alone on your back; bad!, Government regulation on number of vehicles and pricing., 
﻿Great job., Decent money and great flexibility., NO one respects an Uber driver., Use verify
﻿Operations, - free pantry snacks that were never ending - big office - buffet lunch everyday, - extremely few perm staff - politics, 
﻿Company review, Unmatched employee benefitsGood working ambeince Good facilities., As of now nothing as i haven't noticed anything yet., 
﻿Good money if you drive at the right times, Ability to work when you want (including setting an end time), If you're not working in a major city rides can sometimes be few and far between during the week. Sometimes the app will bring you to a "hot spot" but no rides will be available., 
﻿Working skip the dishes and door dash Dleavary and Uber partner, I really liked Uber partner, Uber is the best to work, And I was deactivated by low rating Uber partners
﻿Low Employer-Employee Relations, As an independent Contractor I could set My own hours., No direct supervisor and/or contact for when any issues come up in either direction., You need a better and more direct line of communication with Your Employees and Independent Contractors.
﻿Uber 1.0 is back in full steam, They have done ipo now so we can sell the shares for something, Working us super hard so they can probably lay us off in 6 to 9 months time. 1455 is the worst place to work - so noisy and crowded. There is no desk space to put people. The work pressure is on now. Upper management at engineering sound clueless., 
﻿UberSelect a complete joke UberX/pool unprofittable, They constantly take a huge chunk of your pay making sure you can't really profit from UberX, You fall further in debt than ever before driving around for hours and hours and not getting a single UberSelect customer., 
﻿Uber Driver Incom, Working hours are flexible is the best part. Even with another full-time/ part-time job you can still earn extra cash, Traffic in Chicago is terrible! Starting at 7 am until 8 pm., 
﻿good job, good coworker learn new things good tech good work life balance, many re-org bad management lost changes too much, 
﻿Great Company to work at., Great training phase and team mates., No cons so far., Keep up the good work
﻿KYC Analyst, , , 
﻿Don't Leave Your Day Job, Flexibility and low stress without a doubt., Pay and rules may change at any time. Uber is for their riders and truly care very little about their drivers. Lyft on the other hand seems to truly care for their drivers. I worked for both and much preferred Lyft for that reason., Try being a little bit appreciative for your drivers and quit with the outrageous raping with your auto leasing programs.
﻿Head of Sales, 1. Superb culture 2. Loads of problems to solve for 3. Fast moving 4. Transparent organisation, 1. Too much work for an individual, 
﻿Good place to work, Meritocratic high growth trajectory good culture international mobility, Frequent changes in org structure., 
﻿I enjoy working here, A lot of interesting projects piloting products., Overtimes are possible job security is low, 
﻿Uber, You work when you want. Easy job it is perfect for trying to make money on the side., Sometimes customers will treat you bad. This has only happened to me twice and I’ve been driving for 6+ months! With that being said there really aren’t cons to this job, 
﻿Good Experience, Flat hierarchy. Benefits are good. Food in the office is very good. Growing organization., There is no structure defined for work. One has to figure out by themselves., 
﻿Low wages. No accountability. Exploitation of drivers, You make your own schedule., Too many to list. 1. Blatant exploitation of drivers. 2. They try every dirty trick in the book to get us to work for free. 3. Does not care about the well-being of the drivers or the rider. 4. Only interested in making money. 5. Not transparent. The list goes on and on....., Stop being a shady company.
﻿Not worth it, , , 
﻿Great, Income fluctuations not guaranteed and sometimes you must work additional hours to make rent for the vehicle unless it's your car., Not sure about this unless it is cooperate,

The Account Management Organization at Uber Freight is constantly changing making it an extremely exciting and fast paced environment that never gets boring!, Get ready to become a professional at multi-tasking! Projects Internal clubs and training sessions on top of your daily work is a lot to take on!, 
﻿Great option if you have other stuff going on, Uber is a really supportive environment particularly in the Brisbane office. Management culture is fantastic and they really foster open channels of communication regarding performance. Positive and constructive feedback are both offered regularly. There's a real sense of respect from management towards employees. Customer service representatives are encouraged to put in 110% to make sure we are offering the best possible..., The only opportunities for advancement that open up are in Sydney or overseas. Not a great place to work if you're looking to advance a career within Brisbane. Roles are casual to start with and hours are not always freely available., Keep doing what you're doing. It's clear you respect your employees and that is reflected in the positive culture.
﻿A better Side Hustle Than a Full-Time Position., -Flexible hours. -Good money during busy times (concerts events). -Networking opportunities. -Good money during school season., -During the out of school season its hard to make even $10 an hour. -Uber takes a 25% off the top rate of every ride. -Long hours collecting tax receipts and recording mileage logs. -If tax benefits were not in place Uber would not be worth it., Care more about your drivers because they are your whole infrastructure.

﻿The Best Employer, Career pathCompensations & BenefitsCultureWork balance., overall I am satisfied with Uber and working at Uber., Overall experience is good but if possible I would suggest Uber to increase growth rate of expert level employees.
﻿Awesome, very good work culture easy to grow we do the right thing., i dont know of any, let's keep igniting opportunities by setting the world in motion
﻿All has been great, Strong commitment and wide knowledge, Not bad feedback to provide at this time., All good by this time

﻿Associate program specialist, People first. Great environment and benefits., Hard to grow meritocracy it is not a thing because you need to apply for other roles if you wanna achieve new steps., 
﻿Set the world in motion!, Uber has been a tremendous place to work. Young atmosphere with strong leadership enabling employees to get the most out of each day. The benefits package are second to none (breakfast catered lunches Uber rides/eats)., None at this time., Keep doing what you're doing. Under new leadership Uber has been amazing.
﻿Fantastic fast paced creative and collaborative organisation!, Uber has a fast paced creative and collaborative culture. You will have the opportunity to be involved with many exciting projects and tasks with passionate and enthusiastic people. Everyone is talented supportive and wants to do their best!, A fast paced environment is not for everyone to succeed you need to be autonomous hard working confident and committed., 
﻿Good stepping stone: Decent entry-level money little progression long-term, Starting salary is quite good. Good benefits - health insurance wellness benefits such as gym membership., Little progression available tends to be based on length of service rather then work ethic. Poor Management very little feedback or direction given to employees. Work can become monotonous and repetitive., Provide more direction to employees. Give employees opportunity to progress and challenge themselves.

﻿waste of time to be uber driver, no working under other and no heavy lifting, long hour works out under 6 dol per hour after all cost, commission too high for not good service
﻿Great company culture incredibly fast paced environment, 1) Great company culture - people want to do the right thing 2) Super smart people - haven't yet someone I wasn't impressed by 3) Lots of growth opportunities - the business is growing so you will too! 4) Interesting problems to solve - no one else is doing this work (or very few are), 1) Compensation is WAY below market - you are here because you love working here surely not for the money 2) Start-up hangover - people who have been here for a while have risen to the top; they might not have the right skills or experience 3) Need to figure out HR basics (goal setting performance assessment etc.), Bring compensation up to par with market!
﻿Contracted Uber Expert, Culture startup vibe opportunity perks, Not being able to stay longer than 6 months as I was contractor, N/A
﻿Fast pace and innovation, Family oriented. A lot of benefits, Lack of communication with management, Better understanding of the different positions
﻿Great environment and team, - Free food - Flexible schedule - Great team - Fun activities outside of work, - Messy management - PR problems with top tier management, Working here is awesome overall. However the job tasks can get a bit boring and upper management seems disconnected. Little mobility.
﻿Better for supplemental income, Fast money Get paid daily Upwards of $20 hourly at times, Wear and tear on vehicle Unpredictability High service charges Gas money, Uber should not make more money that drivers on trips AND they should stop taking more than 20% of earnings.
﻿Motivation Diminishes Over Time, You can make a decent amount of money if you drive in a big city and are willing to put in the hours, The monotony of an entire day spent in a vehicle inconvenient or non-existent customer support unsavory passengers, There needs to be more safety mechanisms in place both for the driver and passenger.
﻿It's ok..for contract basis workers, Brand name. Good working atmosphere Can develop our skills, More politics. No hikes and no promotions for contract basis employees, Nothing
﻿Great Experience, As an intern I feel that I'm doing interesting work with the support of amazing colleagues., Some of the offices are a little overcrowded., 
﻿Great, Good job to do according to your own time., Not any according to me, N/A
﻿Overall a good experience for me, Flexibility of schedule was nice, Hidden costs add up fast, 
﻿Do not try, You can drive when you want. Allegedly, You have to pay for your own car Pay your own gas People doesn't tip There is not enough people out making request. Doesnt pay per toll ways Doesnt care if you have an accident They take 50% of what you make per drive Ceo doesn't care, Hire a new CEO
﻿Did the trick, , , 
﻿What it is, Flexibility - bit you must work long hours to survive so not really flexible; ease of entry, pay is very low expenses on your car, And extra dollar per trip would allow humans to live more healthfully mentally and physically and make the world a less hostile place.
﻿Marketing Manager, Culture Work flexibility Office set up team, Work load work life balance, 
﻿Terrible company do not work for them, No fixed schedule no minimum hours and holidays off, Holidays are unpaid and low pay and high fees, Raise your paid and stop focusing on passengers and focus on drivers
﻿Not worth it, Great scheduling flexibility get outdoors walking to pick up and drop off learn your city learn all the best and worst restaurants in town., HORRIBLE PAY!!!!!! In the beginning it was great I averaged $14 an hour which equaled current minimum wage or slightly better after my expenses were taken out. Now you're lucky if you Gross $10 an hour so I quit., Pay people at least minimum wage after their expenses even if this means charging the customer a little more. People tend to be cheap and you cannot make your drivers rely on tips.
﻿Don’t waste your time, Flexible working hours you can make your own schedule., You don’t make enough money, 
﻿Eh, You can work when you want, You have to work all the time to make any money, Pay your employees more than 50%
﻿Loved it, Work at home non phone email support, Temporary jobs outsourced to Manila, 
﻿Good company to work for, I set my own hours and enjoy meeting people and travel to different places every day. With hard work I make the money that I need., Sometimes the app doesn't take me to the right location to pick up the riders. I can use an increase on my income., I'm consider to be a contractor by company standards.
﻿Business lost its vim., - Good benefits. - Catered lunches snacks and drinks provided for free. - Quiet office environment., - Pay is on the low low end compared to other jobs. Similar job titles at other companies are paying $15-20k more a year to start. - Inexperienced management. - Questionable hiring practice. - Losing progression opportunities within the company very quickly. - Becoming restrictive causing a drop in morale that all but managers themselves could see., 
﻿Cool work workplace colleague and benefits, 1. Awesome work and technology 2. Free food and lots of snacks 3. At par compensation 4. Awesome benefits 5. Awesome leadership team. 6. Great vision 7. Employee discount on Uber and UberEats, Company doesn't match 401k hope some day company will look into it., Management is taking great effort to transform company's pubic image. I find it great once in life time company. Just keep making it better and don't ruin it. It can truly transform the future of how people get around.
﻿Great job if you are in between jobs or a college student, I got to work when i wanted to work. I am naturally a night owl so it was a really great job. I also enjoy driving around and listening to the many stories from my riders., they do not tell you every thing. They do not tell you things you can be "suspended" for., 
﻿UBER is a RIP-OFF!!!!, Flexible hours and potential instant pay after Uber's large deduction, UBER is a RIP-OFF!!!! This company is totally ripping off their drivers/employees. The company advertises that their drivers would make this great amount of money. That is current for the company but not the driver. On average Uber takes roughly 50% and the total fare charged to the riders. The drivers and their vehicles are ran into the ground and make basically minimum wage after expenses. On July 24th when..., Quit stealing money from your employees. Run a fair company.
﻿Excellent, - Clear market leader in a space with huge upside competitors will struggle to compete in the long-term - "The power of the platform" is real. Uber's brand and technology allow us to rapidly expand into new markets and onboard customers/vendors - Weekly all-hands meetings to announce major events business updates and a Q&A with top-voted questions answered by top execs. I appreciate the transparency. - The..., - This is a tough market. Will Uber continue to execute toward a path to profitability?, Be transparent reward your employees for their hard work and make the business work
﻿Uber fooling to drivers, Early it gives good business but slowly slowly it cut all benefits like boost surge and incentives per trips. So working forcefully to pay my pending cars EMI, Net earning reduces to 12 / month, Management will go according to there thinking only.
﻿Good company and good money can be frustrating to contact., Good money pick your own hours but puts wear and tear on your car., Damage to peronsal vehicle frustrating to contact uber support., 
﻿great for side work, your own hours great for extra side money, customer dependent peak hours are time consuming to make good money, 
﻿Good to make money, Flexibility Fun Easy Self Pace Relaxing, Lowered Wages Can be Stressful Sometimes Dangerous, 
﻿Couldn't be happier!, "Ideas over hierarchy" is one of the key company pillars and they really do practice what they preach. I haven't been in my role for more than 6 months however I've already contributed to multiple projects that have had an impact across the whole ANZ market. They do more for L&D than I've seen anywhere else - really investing in their employees. They also understand the impact of culture on a workplace and put..., If you're not used to a start-up environment you'll need to prepare yourself for the volatility of things changing extremely quickly - process changes product updates compliance/legal workflow etc., 
﻿Very low standards and respect for drivers, Freedom work life balance no cash handling, Not much work very slow paperwork processing not much support for drivers charge too much commission for the service they provide you for, Need big change. Must take drivers advice and look after them. You make money from them.
﻿Product Analyst Review, You can learn and grow really fast at Uber., Work life balance is not good. People are aggressive. Well the company culture is aggressive., 
﻿Can be good or awful, You can make upwards of $200 in a night if you're at the right place., You can make less than minimum wage some nights. Wear and tear on your vehicle. Have to pay for own gas., 
﻿Not a career but will pay the bills., Make quick money meet nice people., Depreciate your car risk picking up the wrong people and being at the wrong place at the wrong moment., 
﻿Uber eats, Can make money as you please, Rates are horrendously low most times they do not care about their drivers., 
﻿Not worth the pay, Excellent pay. Overtime. Excellent benefits. Casual atmosphere. Brilliant coworkers., Too much overtime expected. 70+ hour work weeks. Weekend and overnight work expected. No personal time. Executives in the Toronto atg office are not willing to hear criticism of their working habits and cause road blocks for others work. Terrible communication. No respect for workers because the executives feel they are above everyone else. Untimely responses to emails and chats causing work delays. Direct..., You are going to have a hard time finding someone to support the executives at the Toronto atg office unless you do some serious management training with them. They dont understand how the assistant relationship works nor do they have any respect for a person's work/life balance other than their own. Expect a lot of turnover in the assistants because of the relationship and work/life balance problems.
﻿Great flexibility, Work anytime 24x7 no boss, Pay rate keeps getting smaller, Driver rewards program could be much improved.
﻿Amazing Organization to work with, , , 
﻿Scam Nightmare, There are no Pros with Uber!, They owe me money for over three weeks. They keep putting the payout a week Everytime I'm expect a bank deposit. It went from July 14 then changed to July 21 now it is July 28. They would not enable my instant pay. They will have you drive for them and don't expect payment.Everytime I call support they give me the run around. They scam their drivers! If you want to waste your money gas and time choose Uber!If you want..., Pay your drivers You scammers!
﻿Experience, Experience was amazing. Great experience, There is no cons really, none
﻿Professional Uber driver, I love driving alotI have a good road network knowledge I know almost all places if I been there just once, Just stressful during raining periods, 
﻿Completely Misleading, You can money if you are desperate mentally ill have to set your own schedule around work kids school caring for a loved one etc.. other than that DONT DO IT!, You wreck your car. You wreck your body. You don't get paid what you think you will. They customer service for drivers is a joke., No advice. We are organizing and we are coming for you!
﻿The work suits me. The pay does not., My own boss work when I want no micro management but Uber as third party platform is a wealthy well-known brand with built in customer loyalty., Sadly that base took a quick hard liking to Uber's "no tipping" message and now cannot be unbrainwashed but not sure customers should have to supplement my income on behalf of a company that gets paid three times from one delivery. Four if you count that they bought the electric bike company I rent from in order to deliver food. You would think they could at least subsidize the company bike! There us no gas cost practically..., Uber regularly solicits feedback in app about how I feel. For the most part I am happy when working and they do have an actual live operator to help with problems in the field. I gotta say the fine people of the Phillipines have the patience of saints on the rare hopefully occasions I call at the end of my waits and let the frustration leak into my voice. But yeah I keep in touch with Uber and give honest feedback...

﻿Overrated, Good hours brand for resume, Culture remains terrible despite efforts to change it, 
﻿Smooth and easy to pick up hours, Flexible Good weekend rates, Wear is taken on car, I'm glad that there is call assistance now rather than just the green light program.
﻿Great opportunity and life changing flexibility, Flexible independent ability to make more money incentives and promotions referral bonus, Wear and tear on the vehicle should be higher pay with all things considered cost wise., Provide higher promotions as an Uber diamond driver.
﻿Joined for a Career.... Staying for the Money, Compensation Benefits Flexibility. Nothing else to add, No learning Biased managers No Meritocracy Disgraceful Integrity of leadership. All gyaan and no action by management, Change the leaders. Teach them to be empathetic and understanding

﻿PSR, The Work Environment is really Nice No formal clothing and all you can even go to office in a jeans and a tee all employees are provided with MACBOOK and Iphone to work, You can expect sudden work calls which can be hectic at times., 
﻿A great challenging place to work, - Always something new we're working on - Super helpful people - Impact of work easily seen - Promotions are fair and easier than at other companies - Well known brand - Great medical and Uber product benefits, - Lower pay - Internal messaging tools need work, - Increase salary offers to retain top talent - Invest in data structure and internal tools
﻿This place is really cool, Nothing was very good at this place, I really don't like working at all, give up
﻿Graphic Designer, Flexible time with friendly work environment, Less opportunities for the growth, 
﻿Great benefits terrible change management, The benefits are fantastic (free lunches unlimited PTO monthly Uber credits). You can move up and get opportunity as a young person which I found wasn’t as true at Amazon (age-ist). It’s relatively easy to move internationally., Uber is terrible at change management and can’t figure out how it wants to structure the company. I’ve been through 6+ reorgs in the 1.5 years at the company. In two of these reorgs it was counter goals to the previous one (hire more decentralized offices > centralize in 2 cities etc.). If Uber wants to be treated like an established company post-IPO it’s leadership team needs to step it up and learn the basics..., Stop the constant reorgs so people can get some work done. Realize that many teams work remotely / are always on the road and that forcing people to sit in the same office doesn’t mean they’ll actually be next to each other.
﻿A good job for those with odd hours, Can make your own hours and make a decent wage, More people are working here now so opportunities are less unless you live in a busy area., 
﻿Not Quite The Culture of Uber 2.0 - A Ways to Go, Unfortunately Uber 2.0 is not quite there yet. I witnessed a number of inappropriate things from middle-management - "let's put you over her since you're black" - and many immature comments from managers that I've never seen at other companies. Some of these types of employees are gone; some are not. Many but not all middle managers tend to be "the last one standing" rather possess true leadership and management..., Remember - a good business model is one thing but employees are everything. Middle management should be vetted based on people skills. Teach them to lead with carrots good vision and missions rather than reactively with heavy-handed sticks., 
﻿Horrible job, You have flexible work hours, Every getting good at it you only make about $10.00 in hour. That is the Gross I consider this to be a business. However we were competing with taxi cabs which charged three times what Uber did. How could Uber do this they had very low overhead. The drivers use their own cars and must pay for gas insurance and repairs on our own cars. Most riders I talked to said they would pay much because they realized that this..., Start running your business so that you like a business look out for your driver's first that they can make money like you do. Your customer service told me that it was a safety issue. The reason why taxi charge more it to make a profit and make sure they have enough to make timely repair. I wonder many of your driver's are driving unsafe cars because they can't afford to make timely repairs.
﻿Don't take this as a option, Flexibility to your time and life., Not a good deal in exchange to your car spending, 
﻿No Benefits, Good paying job during events and Life work balance., Pay is not that great and No benefits that a driver could afford at all., Raise Pay Affordable Health Insurance and Retirement Benefits.
﻿Great Place To Work, - great pay and benefits - great work environment - strong workplace community, You get spoiled by the perks very quickly. Stay grateful!, Keep it up.

﻿15 to 25$ per hour, , , 
﻿Best place in the world, Changing the world at a very fast pace, none that comes to my mind, Keep up with the awesome work!
﻿Constantly lowering pay outs for drivers., Easy to get started be your own boss explore your city., Dropping Pay Poor Support(canned responses) and clients can be obnoxious., Increase advertising to eliminate competition and provide more support for your drivers.
﻿Uber Driver, You can make your own schedule., Uber cares more about the rider than the driver so if the rider makes a mess in your car uber doesn't care and if a rider is raciest towards a driver its' ok with uber., Take your drivers serious because you have no clue what we go through.
﻿Not as expected, - Prepared team - Nice perks - Benefits - Stock Options, - Highly competitive environment - Constant improvisation - Top management lack of vision/experience - Disorganization - Boring work environment, 
﻿Uber Eats - Sales Representative, The office culture is a lot of fun. It’s a great place to grow and learn as an entry level seller with a people in a competitive environment. Also best company benefits I’ve ever seen., If you don’t hit your quota at 100% every month you’re fired. At least 2-3 people fired a month. There was also a number of people quitting because they knew early on they weren’t hitting their quota and were looking for other jobs. If you’re new they don’t care. Everyone is replaceable. Its stressful panicking every month not knowing whether or not it will be your last month. The base salary is very disappointing and..., Build the current employees you have to be irreplaceable.
﻿Busy but good, Breadth of projects spanning analytics program management product team interactions and global team/travel, Easy to get too busy and to stay at the office too long, Match 401k. Betting on uber stock for retirement is kind of risky
﻿Amazing amazing amazing, I worked here for over a year and I adored it! The people are your family here and the company culture is brilliant. The benefits are also excellent!, The one and only con is work life balance due to shift work!, 
﻿Great place to work!, Perks innovative and positive atmosphere ability to work on cutting edge solutions with the best and brightest from around the world!, No complaints at this time, 
﻿BEST JOB EVER, Culture is great perks are awesome! i love coming to work every day and this company really values their employees and reward them when hard work is done. I love this company and will never leave., There are none!! I love my job!!, 
﻿Uber, It is an incredible place to develop yourself and help to change the world's motion, A lot of negative news about the company, 
﻿Great company for an internship, the "lean management" and the "ownership" concept multicultural environment plus lot of perks, working hours can be tough but it is the key to success, 
﻿Uber Driver - Oklahoma, Good support line established between myself and corporate. No complaints on anything that hindered my ability to complete the job., No complaints from the perspective of an Uber Driver!, 
﻿Good working environment but extreme centralization, Good working environment flexible working hours., Extreme centralization to decisions and only data driven attitude leads to delay/ inappropriate decision making., 
﻿Not bad, Work on your hours and work anywhere, Uber takes to much fees, 
﻿Incredible workplace, Culture is incredible opportunity to move Into new roles autonomy to take on and own projects catered lunch provided CEO is inspiring product innovations daily., If you struggle to work autonomously and respond poorly to change it’ll be a struggle., Keep doing what you’re doing.
﻿I love Uber!, Good environment Nice colleagues Great perks and benefits *Free Food (unlimited snacks and 1 full course meal) *Transportation Allowance *Health card (250k per illness per year) * Performance incentives, 10 leave credits per year only Shifting schedule, 
﻿Review, Pay - Above average Benefits - Free food Environment - Friendly and lenient, NA NA NA NA NA, More engagement activities
﻿Worst company ever, None of any real value, Low earnings high risk to personal vehicle awful "support" they treat you as a disposable commodity they steal driver tips and theres nothing you can do about it. DO NOT WORK FOR UBER., Pay your drivers a fair wage instead of taking the majority of fares for your self actually listen to drivers instead of pretending to care.
﻿Great place to work, - Engineering best practices - Mentors - Positive & Friendly co-workers - High compensation / salary - Beautiful campus - Healthy food & snacks - Uber / Uber Eats credits - Flexible work hours - you choose what times to be in the office, I can't see any at the moment, 
﻿A Breathe of Fresh Air, I love working for this company. They love to promote from within and make sure to provide you with the skills necessary to advance. They are also very transparent and keep their employees engaged in all of aspects of the business. Did I mention free breakfast and lunch everyday? Great place to work!, I honestly have nothing negative to say regarding working for Uber Freight!, 
﻿Great Flexability, I love being able to work my own schedule. The ability to fit the job around your life is great. The recent changes that the company has made have made me feel better about getting out there and driving. The best thing was adding destinations and being able to set a quit time when I really need to be somewhere but want to be available to drive as long as possible., There is no guarantee of work or pay so when the company does too much advertising for new drivers work becomes even more limited. Also it would be nice to get a greater percentage when completing rides., None at this time.
﻿Driver, No pros I can think of., Extra minimum wage for drivers. All the good reviews in here comes from employees who sit relaxed and comfortable behind the desk drinking coffee and eating free lunch at the expense of hard working drivers. Shame on Uber., Take more social responsibility
﻿Very flexible, Lots of freedom to work, No job security or future, Look into Job security for drivers.
﻿Good place, low income not enough rides ok for part time, increase wages more rides and will be ok, 
﻿Great place to work if you're up 2 the challenge, Flexible Fast-Paced plenty of smart cookies meritocracy, You need to follow or be left behind., 
﻿Great, Work whenever you want. Decent pay if you work during boost hours. Easy job., Hours/pay is inconsistent. Long hours sometimes with little pay., 
﻿Strong internal mobility culture great people. HR org structure and compensation still need improvement, - Internal mobility - Smart people to work with - Really interesting business problems - Strong mission statement, - Starting to feel like a corporate in terms of processes - Org structure is still evolving - Compensation is low compared to street value - Poor work life balance, 
﻿Great side job., Got to meet lots of people, Have to drive during busy times of the day, 
﻿It started out great & got worse from there financially speaking...but grateful for the experience., Flexible hours & instant pay., Long hours 1000 miles average per week on my car 1000s of 5 star trips lowered our earnings repeatedly hardly any tips & no respect or bonuses for us "loyal long term drivers"...AND LYFT IS THE SAME!! They both suck but again I'm grateful for when it was 1st good & the experience!, Nothing to add.
﻿Uber Great, Work when you want as much as you want, Hard on the body, Stop showing drivers what customers pay

﻿Operations, , , 
﻿Great place to work, Benefits and Schedule I love the catering everyday., I wish we could not wear uniform or at least something more professional., 
﻿Fast-Paced Lots of Autonomy and High Expectations, Everyone I'm surrounded by is impressively intelligent and brings their own zest to the table. Uber really encourages employees to find their passion and work that passion into their work. You're trusted to work flexibly with the assumption that you're getting everything done. Other benefits: free breakfast/lunch snacks coffee. Unlimited/encouraged PTO., Definitely find myself working very long hours some days. Also things change extremely quickly which can be good sometimes but other times causes for a bit of confusion., 
﻿Burn out quick and inevitable, You get to pick your own hours, It takes forever to reach your goal if you have a full-time goal that is. Long hours in the car. No interaction with people really (except the ones that come into your car and let's just say they're not all the pick of the litter). It's a very rushed lifestyle you can forget about the life you had if you did have one and all you do is dump the money you make back into repairs for your car. No bueno. 2-3 months maximum..., 
﻿Compensation, Immediate compensation work schedule flexibility., Reduced payouts to employees company's lack of long-term commitment to contractors., The employer's reduction of payouts did little to took significantly affected drivers motivation. It was a mistake which makes it more difficult to find and retain employees.
﻿Ubereats’s is good, Good pay  good hours !, Customer could be more tips !, 
﻿Great job for students, Work as many hours as you want., No health benefits or retirement.,

﻿General Overview of Driving with Uber., Flexible working arrangements you'll never know where you'll end up on the roads at the end of a shift., Payments aren't Immediate and it's sometime hard to get fares and passengers based of geographic location issues., I drive a smaller car and It would be nice that the customer is able to select the type of car they want like in terms of space and volume in the cabin and boot. That would greatly improve efficiencies of the customer experience That's my only issue with the Uber App but other than that it's an awesome app to use and the User Interface is super easy to use and manoeuvre around and navigate to what you need. An awesome...

﻿Flexible hours, , , 
﻿Average, - Cool Office - Surrounded by high-performing people, - very cliquey. as a contract worker there were complaints by the full time managers for taking from the office snacks - cut throat culture zero regard for uber drivers., 
﻿Not bad but not good, , , 
﻿Gig Economy Job meant only for "extra" income, Instant Payouts High schedule flexibility Easy to get started, Earnings don't consider car depreciation Lack of boosts quests and high concentration of other Uber drivers in certain areas can lead to low earnings per hour Poor customer and driver support offered by the company Most costs are placed upon the driver, 
﻿Uber Driver, it's always been flexible timings with uber, It's not a continuous job you have to wait for the job, 
﻿Great work place and environment, All in all an amazing place, Uber is too good to have any cons per se, 
﻿Great Job!, You work on your own time and when demand is high there is money to be made, The cost of maintenace on your car is higher and gas isn't cheap.,

﻿Great Place to Change the World, - Amazing teams and culture - Great professional development programs in place and many more in development - Challenging interesting and impactful work - Very transparent company, - Uber is always under a lot of scrutiny in media and politics so we have to tread carefully as a company in anything we do and think many times before implementing new initiatives, 
﻿Fun Company, , , 
﻿Terrible experience with this company., Good opportunity to learn new skills and take proactive steps to further your career., The culture is toxic. Do not recommend this company to anyone. Some of the managers on the user experience team are completely incompetent in their role. Favoritism is a huge problem within the team., Weed out the managers who create a toxic team culture. HR should do something about employees who have received multiple complaints about them.
﻿Avoid at all costs, Set your own schedule but that is about it, low pay does not support sustaining the car. Support does not care about you Customers will actively try to get you fired because they were required to follow safety procedures. People will try to kill you and rob you for money you do not have. Other drivers are low IQ drones that will sing uber praises while their cars fall apart and do not understand that other drivers are not their friends., Stop wasting your money on your lifestyle and hobbies and actually pay your drives.
﻿Horrible company., Work when you want to, They take 25% of what you make plus they charge fees you don't receive any money for. Just reduced pay for employees 25%, Happy employees who feel a part of a company make better employees.

﻿Life Changing Experience, Fast-paced quick results-type of work. Uber is a special place where “best ideas win” and you are able to make changes/innovate and see results quickly. Work-life balance was tough in the early days (necessary) and got to a very comfortable state later on. The ppl they surround you with at Uber are legends. Truly some of the smartest ppl I’ve ever had the pleasure being around. Uber changed my life and I highly recommend..., Once Uber got big (ie: 10k+ employees) they really have a hard time tracking what ppl do and should be “cutting the fat” of ppl with no impact a lot sooner. Early employees got paid poorly for the amount of work it took to grow the company (can’t speak to what employees make now) but who cares it was all worth it for the stock!, Hire slow and fire fast. No use keeping ppl who don’t bleed the mission arounf.
﻿No shortage of interesting challenges, * I strongly believe in the company's mission. While other top tech companies are all competing to steal your time Uber is giving you the time back by getting you/things/food from point A to point B as fast as possible. * Almost everyone I know uses our products and it feels great to know how it works internally and to be able to influence its future. * A lot of interesting challenges with plenty of opportunities to..., * Uber receives a lot of attention in the news. When it's not positive - it can be discouraging, I've seen the talent bar falling lower recently. This is discouraging. I would recommend management to watch that closely and make sure the low performers are first offered help to improve but if that doesn't work - let go. Otherwise the strong engineers will be demotivated and will leave.
﻿Good Organization, , , 
﻿It's really a mixed bag, Get to work with fun intelligent people, Leadership does not care about your development, 
﻿UBER is a total mess. Junior and unprofessional people working there from recruiting to management., - Stock allocation - Competitive salary, - Junior workers - Lack of processes - Unprofessional, Hire seasoned professionals instead of kids. It's time to grow up as a company. You are not working in a garage anymore.
﻿UberEats is a great middle-point between Startup and big Corp; learning opportunities make up for downsides, - Exciting interesting work that is impactful - Everyone is incredibly smart and motivated and quite young - True autonomy for work - Collaborative - Very fun analytical role - Very easy access to leadership and management (they are friendly + are usually like speaking to a peer), - Pay is decent but not really comparable; I took a 25% pay cut for this role however there was an equity component and some other great perks (bfast & lunch at office uber cash/month etc.) - Less emphasis on diversity than I would like - Some people work too hard... I guess they like their jobs a lot :-) but pay isn't enough to compensate super long hours, Due to the amount of transparency at Uber/UberEats the management is already aware of employee issues (compensation diversity initiatives stress management).
﻿Customer support, Great workplace young coworkers monthly events employee benefits, I do not see any cons yet, 
﻿Run. Far., Work whenever you want I guess. Not worth it though trust me., Literally everything else. Pay is lower than minimum wage at times no one tips Uber doesn't help with gas even though you're using your vehicle for their company your vehicle WILL wear down and break down with all the miles you drive passengers don't care and WILL slam your doors/leave trash everywhere/puke/etc Uber doesn't let you carry a gun to protect yourself with Uber's customer service is slow and mostly unhelpful..., Start actually giving a crap about your drivers increase the fares pay for our gas and stop taking the customer's word for it when there's an issue with the trip because 99% of the time they're either lying or the issue was their fault.
﻿Yet another scam by uber, Flexibility. That's all. No other benefit, Net pay "profit" is on average $10 to $12 per hour. Uber wants you to believe it's a lot more. It's a lie. Also touts to drivers "we have you covered" . Another lie. If damage occurs to your car you're out of pocket up to $1000. On both counts Uber dishonestly doesn't mention the details., You are going to run out of Romanian ex credit card fraudsters as your driver supply pool. Stop fawning over rider acquisition and focus on driver retention otherwise it's better to flip burgers for more money and less stress.
﻿Very disorganized company to work for., Nothing to say good about them., I tried to work with them. I sent my documents and I was 3 times in the office in Downtown to open my account before start to work. Somebody made mistake with my personal information and take so long to open my account. I tried to contact the Huber support but nobody help properly and they don’t care about you. I spend my money to parking my car few times to go to the office in downtown and also hours by phone to dissolve..., No have any communication with the team.
﻿Easy to sign up lots of business at the right times, Easy to sign up make you own hours pretty decent pay if you drive at the right times, Can be dangerous as you are picking up strangers, 
﻿Strategy, Company treats employees well, Unstructured environment and poor career progression,

﻿Product Marketing Manager, , , 
﻿Uber Multi-Mobilty (Not a driver), Great culture and group of passionate people. Pay is decent and flexability is nice., Not as polished as some might think considering how much capital they're working with. A lot of it is "flinging pasta on the wall and seeing what sticks". There is a disconnect between the warehouse crew and office staff and especially between "real" Uber employees and "ext" (contract) employees., Remember that the ext employees are the backbone of the operation and try to bring some on as "full fledged" employees... that's all we really want.
﻿Great to develop yourself, Informal Positive Lack of stress Food entertainment, Management is bad HR is bad People are not prared for the jobs they do, 
﻿Technical Account Manager, Dynamic challenging fast-moving environment. Very talented and smart people all around which is great. Very high level of dedication and commitment which I have not seen anywhere else., Fast growth sometimes can create some lack of clarity on procedures and workflows which can change every month., Keep up the great work and sense of missions and belonging great onboarding process and sense of responsibility - act like an owner
﻿Amazing place to work, Challenging environment with some of the best people I've worked with. People are ambitious and riven but in a positive cooperative manner. Uber gives you a lot of room to define how you add value in your role and is very open to new suggestions., Demanding environment which can be stressful if you're not able to prioritize properly. High need to be flexible and self driven., 
﻿Intrapreneur's haven, Autonomy there's a lot of self-management. And the work you do really can make an impact., Things move extremely fast so must be agile and adaptable to keep up., 
﻿Great place to grow, They give great opportunities to learn and grow very fast. Very generous culture of teaching and helping out., Not fully prepared to receive interns. There's no specific internship program and sometimes we end up in the limbo., 
﻿Best Job Ever, Great vibe in office lot of out of job activities fine benefits program., I do not see any huge cons for me the salary system could be more visible (not sure if it depends on Uber or state) i have also heard that career paths is not so clear as on other companies (can not confirm for sure because I am working 3 months., 
﻿Fast grow and change company, Work with a lot of ownership, Change and grow fast by the needs, 
﻿Good but not as good as it was, Nice employee perks Regional work scope, Bad salary compared to other companies Culture has changed a lot and is still in "healing" stage, 
﻿Life at Uber, Great benefits and very smart people, Most people do anything to get ahead no work life balance, Put people first
﻿Last resort, Quick cash get to connect with others drive on your time, All vehicle expenses are yours business is not guaranteed take home is 50 percent of what the client pays. Uber takes the other 50 percent., Reduce what you take from drivers or start covering vehicle problems from oil changes to tires or other things from wear and tear.
﻿NJ and Philly Uber, , , 
﻿Partnership Specialist, Great people to work with on your team and across other teams free lunch large office space, Far commute to 12th avenue no windows in office space low salary not much room for growth, Pay your team more so that people will stay and you don't have to waste time training new people every month.
﻿Lots of cheerleaders very little content., - good salary & benefits for Brazilian standards - highly qualified & capable co-workers - nice work environment: everything is modern & sleek so it makes you feel good. - San Francisco's leadership is genuinely trying to improve its relationship with employees riders and drivers., - everybody is in denial about the successive financial losses of Uber - departments often hate each other; lots of managers with major egos that don't allow collaboration as it's all about them them them. - people leave the company very fast. This means they are unhappy also means that all the time you have to find who to access because the person you knew left last week. All. The. Time. And it will be much worse..., Managers should not fire their best people for fear of being superseded and replaced. Performance reviews are seriously misguided and unfair; the manager's bias will always influence other managers to grade well or badly an employee's work.
﻿Room for Improvement., Uber is making constant changes and there are plenty of opportunities for upward mobility. The benefits are undeniable and are what keeps people satisfied with their position. Hoping there won't be many changes to these in the future., There is very poor communication in all forms. People that have been with this company for a long period of time have very poor work ethic and will do the bare minimum to get by. It seems like the company cares the same amount about those going above and beyond and those who are outright disrespectful in their outputs. If team leads were given more authority to make decisions and impose sanctions for poor behavior I think..., Get rid of the people that aren't doing their jobs. They are toxic to the community and are making this job 10x harder for those that really care to be here. It is easy to see those people that are here for the paycheck and those who care so listen to those employees who are constantly putting out their best work and take their comments seriously. Taking shortcuts is guiding us towards failure and so many of us are working...
﻿Unique Company With a Great Culture, - Great culture: lots of inclusion every colleague literally replicates that behaviour - Great colleagues who provide a lot of support regardless if they are busy or not. - Interesting challenges: managing transportation at a global level brought to the engineers unique challenges. - Top compensation and perks: food Uber credits additional health coverage (League is awesome) great base and stock options - Fast..., - Moving fast sometimes produces not the best quality thus lots of oncall (does not apply to me yet), I am impressed by the Dara's and the CEO-team commitment to build open inclusive and diverse environment. They are not afraid to answer the hardest questions in front of the whole org. I have never seen such attitude before.
﻿We ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion!, Autonomy! I've never worked with such autonomy as here. I am working on my personal development both with my manager the manager of my manager and some courses and tools using the 70 20 10 rule., I actually don't have any cons right now., 
﻿My experience, Working at uber gave me platform to start my own business while still working with them. And also meet people., Working at uber requires time and energy., To review and reduce the amount/percentage they charge on drivers.
﻿Make your own schedule, I have been driving uber for approximately a year and a half. This is a very flexible job that allows you to work as little or as much as you desire. I am personally a full-time college student so this is the perfect job to work between my academic schedule. I only really drive on the weekends for anywhere between 5 - 15 hours. This provides me with enough money to make it through the week before having to drive the..., Driving in cities picking up passengers and having meaningful conversations can be draining. When you think about driving for five consecutive hours you might think that is not too bad. But when you drive in a city is it a lot different than a road trip. You need to be on your A game at all time with your undivided attention on the road and the changing situations. Maintaining full attention and focus at all times..., I love the instant pay. Being able to pay myself whenever convenient is revolutionary.
﻿Great job, , ,

﻿Excellent place to work. Great team of young minds.

﻿I left a nightmare of hypocrisy, My co-workers were awesome., I had 5 different managers in the 2.5 yrs I was here. My last manager was the most toxic person I've ever encountered in my entire life. We were constantly encouraged to speak up against bully management and when I did I was shown the door. This individual was not respectful of my mental health conditions and was downright insulting on a regular basis. I actually had started up a lawsuit against him and was told that..., Do what you say you're going to do and fire abusive management and stop protecting them!
﻿So far so good, - Exciting and inspiring mission to change the world - Dara seems like a great leader - Huge company with lots of opportunities to work on different types of problems - Good tech stack - Competitive compensation and benefits - Moves quickly for a large company, Tech processes etc a bit more chaotic than I would have expected from a large company, Eng management at another big company I worked seemed to be more willing to make hard decisions on standardizing on technology and tools.
﻿Great experience, Love the benefits + culture of the team, Fast paced constantly on the move, 
﻿Share ride driver, Salary and benefits are substandard once you total up all of your expenses to be a share ride driver. Traffic pedestrians and road work is often high risk for being in and accident. Uber's GPS is seriously flawed to the point of being unsafe. Uber's driver support team are managed to being mindless drones and are usually no help what so ever. A small percentage of riders are distracting annoying and possibly dangerous., Improve on the cons I have listed above. Treat your drivers well. They will make or break your company. I have do doubt that your driver turn over rate is high This increased your chances for accidents. Accidents are costly., 
﻿Awesome, Own boss and own hours., Wait time for trips., 
﻿Great company and Strong Team, All the teams work really hard on all the projects and willing to walk extra miles. Always something keeps you excited., Work-life balance is not something that you will able to get in this company (at least at this moment). Also special projects may come up from nowhere and take up most of your time with tons of meeting., 
﻿It was okay, Flexible timing work your own hours low stress, Low pay repetitive you’re stuck in your car the whole day, Pa
﻿Best Job I've Had, Benefits starting day 1 Helpful cheerful environment Uber perks Personal Training Managers that care, Office Drama Getting called out for when Internal systems do not work, Treat complaints and concerns (especially harassment) seriously.

﻿If you like strange and unorganized you have found the right place!, - Interesting problems to work on - Opportunity to change an industry - Work in San Francisco, - Performance reviews and compensation are dictated purely by manager - Wildly different compensation packages - Poor mid-level management - Uber ATG is unorganized and misdirected, 
﻿Worst driver customer support, Zero not worth to register. I wasted money on doing safety., 1. Driver customer support people has zero knowledge of what they do. 2. They don't understand your issues 3. They are bunch of idiots 4. No one really wants to solve the issue. 5. No one takes responsibility., Why the hell you have in support team who knows nothing they just a piece of ****
﻿One of the best places to work in Europe in tech, Background: I’ve worked at top tech companies in Stockholm Berlin and London before including Facebook. Uber in Amsterdam is on the top of the range both for engineering culture/excellence and compensation. For expats like myself the 30% tax ruling and no capital gains tax make compensation especially attractive - especially as Uber grants meaningful stock on top of strong base salary & bonus as part of the..., Working with the SF HQ is something that will keep being logistically challenging - in planning phases of projects meetings after 6pm will be common. As we head towards IPO we have more processes - as lightweight as they aim to be they do add up and result in more mandatory annual trainings. As Uber is very transparent internally the noise levels on email eng planning and all hands will be high: you need to..., Keep autonomy and impact of teams high while keeping to recruit the world-class talent we have.
﻿Sometimes it's ok sometimes not, , , 
﻿Good Employer, , , 
﻿Highly developmental but uncoordinated., Uber is great for developing professional skills and is wonderful for someone who takes initiative and is creative. If you are employed by Uber take advantage of the WEALTH of development opportunities!, As things are changing so much Uber struggles sometimes to maintain structure internally. People are constantly changing roles and priorities so sometimes things get buried or forgotten. While working for Uber you MUST try to stay organized., Be transparent to employees. Trust employees. Don't keep secrets that affect employee's well-being and careers. There is a lot of bureaucracy which needs to change.
﻿Opportunity to build but be cautious of burnout., Innovative team problem solvers ability to become owners., Uncertainty around contract to full-time transition., 
﻿It's a great job you get to meet new people and get paid for it you also work on your own schedule, You make your own schedule and there is literally no work stress, You put miles on your car and can make less on some days, None I love this company by far my favorite job ever if I made more I'd never leave
﻿Great place to learn write the future and meet smart coworkers., A dynamic young data-driven company that is constantly challenging you to think in different ways and you see the real impact of your work. The team is amazing and everyone brings their honest version of themselves to work as we value diversity. I have learned much more during this time than what other people learn at the same time in other companies because my level of autonomy and responsibility is very high. Fun..., We work very hard on problems that have never existed before so the environment is ambiguous and there is no hand holding as everyone is working at lightning speed. People that want stability or micromanagement will not find the job they need. English is a strong requirement so a lot of candidates can't make the process., Keep it up!

A LOT of information at your disposal in terms of the company career development cultural norms  any and all concerns you might have. Everybody is friendly and approachable. Encouraging environment plenty of resources to grow and learn. Everybody is treated like a grown-up., There's so much effort into company culture and development that it might feel like too much if you're not used to it. It can be overwhelming. Also you can see how the stereotypical startup culture clashes with attempts to be a best-practices place to work. (everybody is tired and overworked all of the time and proud of it).

Also dillhole immediate managers do not help to keep the employees working well.

﻿Great job no boss work on your own time, You work at your pace. Something that is so beautiful about it. However unlike a 9 to 5 you dont get paid for every hour being there. For example I didnt get paid driving to the restaurant. You get paid driving to the persons house to deliver the food. Sometimes that will take you on the outskirts of town and that will mean you will have to drive back to all the restaurant destinations and that will be a little annoying..., Dont get paid driving to therestaurant. Only accept orders that arent like 20 minutes away So within like a 10 minute drive. If you dont accept an order I believe your acceptance rate goes down. Let's say you are a teen or college student living in your parents house trying to make extra money and want to do uber eats. Unless the insurance holder is you you cant do it. That's why I switched to door dash because..., I think we should get paid driving to the restaurant. Also I believe like any job we should get paid at least 8 dollars per hour in addition to the deliveries. People rarely tip us. It would be a much more affordable way of doing business with uber eats.

﻿Uber Driver, When you need some quick cash Ubering is a great way to make some. Work a few hours or the whole week it’s up to you. Sometimes you may get quest promotions that will allow you earn more after finishing a certain amount of rides., Ubering was best during the start of the company. It’s been a downhill ride for everyone who decides to drive for Uber. Quest promotions are way less frequent and they implemented a point system with three or four tiers to reach. It’s a new scheme to get drivers to do more work with the promise of bigger rewards on the last tier. So you have to do 800 rides if you’re lucky to get to the highest level. They make so much..., Bring back guaranteed quest promotions every week and weekend.

You are always going to feel comfortable working here where everyone respect and appreciate diversity., This could be considerate cons or pro depends on the way you see it. Sometimes could be frustrating all the changes that a technology company as Uber brings in your everyday work the great thing is you are never going to be in a boring routine the "bad thing" is you have to keep moving always!., 
﻿Best choice I've made., Awesome environment everyone is helpful and kind and I really see an opportunity to grow., I can not see any., 
﻿Super team super energy and super learnings, I've joined Uber several months ago. I'm really glad to be part of a very dedicated team where people show good energy and empowerment on a daily basis. On top of that I am learning a lot from a scaled company that continues to grow fast., Nothing to mention I am quite happy from everything I've experienced here., Keep giving people the opportunity to be owner of the company !
﻿Don't drive for Uber, The ONLY pro is you work when you want., Very low pay. After expenses you make less than minimum wage. Uber riders are cheap and expect to be babied. This company has destroyed the on demand transportation business. Drivers used to actually make good money before Uber. Now you can make more working for McDonalds., Raise the per mile price. $0.72/ mile is an insult. You can't even properly maintain your vehicle at this price. Cost of living in Colorado springs has nearly tripled in the last 4 years yet Uber stills pays the same. RAISE THE PRICE!!!!!!!!

Benefits and non-work related activities are very good as well. Here there’s never a boring day., Recruting process is slow you have to be patient. People here are all very talented that can be a little overwhelming., 
﻿Great People Chaotic Processes, Uber has some of the most exciting and enthusiastic people I ever met in my 15 year career journey. The mission of uber really impacts people and you can experience this first hand. You automatically feel proud when you join this organisation on how much difference you are actually making to the lives of normal people around the world, The company still operates in startup mode although strong steps are being made to move away from this approach. It is quiet messy still on the inside and you will have to stretch yourself quiet frequently beyond your immediate job scope and you may find that this impacts your performance and goals. It is challenging everyday and not always fun but you also have days when you feel it is worth it. This is definitely..., Appreciate the great changes everyone is trying to make to grow uber into a more mature organisation but it feels that the tools provided to us lower the management line donot cater for the speed the company is changing. You are expected to change so many things without any communication coming down from your seniors to back you up with your other stakeholders. Also management MUST be highly aware of change management...
﻿Surprisingly... Good, - Healthcare benefits for dependents - Benefits for employees - Salary grade - Environment, - Lack of coordination with other teams - Lack of mentoring - Needs improvement in classroom management and engagement, Enhance the classroom experience.
﻿Uber Driver partner, I am my own boss and decide when and where to work., Sometimes to many Uber drivers in the same parking lot., Find ways to motivate full time drivers.
﻿People Operations, The people and the energy. It is an amazing place to work!!, It can be chaotic at times, 
﻿Great Place to Work, Employee liberty and Employee centric organisation with lot of benefits to staff which is good but there was no control over it hence misuse may happen., Should also have stringent HR guidelines when lot of liberty given to resources there is a possibility of misuse at Uber policies people try to play around so need to mitigate the same HR guidelines to be little stringent., As mentioned in Cons
﻿It's a great challenge, Challenging work that builds your skillset for what the future will require, Realtime responsibilities lead to less personal time, 
﻿Typical Startup Culture, Management did best to try and cater to all employees. Communication between departments was good but you had to really try to get answers, See what sticks style management was at times stressful as flows were changed constantly., 
﻿Good company for supplementing my income, , , 
﻿Has it's ups and downs, flexibility cash daily freedom you can uber anywhere, sometimes long waits for not enough money have had pay issues support sucks and they never ask about the other side to a complaint or issues with trips and threaten to deactive your account., I know there's people who take advantage but get the facts first before you penalize a driver. especially if they followed procedure.
﻿Good for extra money, Selecting your own schedule and quickly reviving earnings., Saturation of market during events chasing loss of earnings across the board., 
﻿Amazing journey, Being part of a company that impacts so many people´s lives every day - all around the world work with the most interesting and diverse team in a respectful challenging and fun atmosphere it´s a once in a lifetime opportunity. This is a company that is not only taking care of our present is also encouraging us to think of our future and career path, It´s very challenging to stay updated in a company that is evolving every second, 
﻿Great experience for the future!, - Direct visible impact - Space for innovation - Very skilled teams focused on making big positive changes - Global scale, - Onboarding and ramp up on off-shore locations could be improved, 
﻿Great Place to Work, * Changing the world. * Co-workers are super smart -- and super friendly/helpful/supportive. * Interesting work. * Good work/life balance. * Perks (like free lunch) * Constant learning * Extremely competitive compensation * "Unlimited" PTO * Nice offices. * Potential upside of equity, * Much less time actual coding than at some jobs. * Due to consequences of bugs getting out into the wild very slow development process. * Potential downside of equity, Keep up the good work.
﻿Lots to learn but contract is a big hiccup!, - Work wise you are treated no different to a full time employee - Steep learning curve lots of responsibility right from the start - The Uber brand name - Ease of transfer from one role to another (still contractual though), - Lack of benefits that FTs receive (Uber credits Macbooks Corporate card Stock options Better pay etc.) - Lack of access to opportunities (Global All Hands working in different geographies) - No definite growth path to converting to FT, Uber Eats has been in India for about 2 years. You have to value contractual employees as equals and define a clear growth path for them. That's the only hiccup.
﻿Community support representative, Diversity development teamwork organization benefits, Rotational shifts no transportation to all areas, 
﻿Great company and Culture, Great benefits you get to work with very bright people. that helps you to improve your own performance. You can be your best self., It's not for everyone. The bar is high and there's a lot to do each day., Keep listening to employees.

﻿Good Company to work for., Good opportunities for growth awaiting the company. Good perks like free lunch. Good benefits., Not open enough hours for the partners., keep the good work.
﻿Exciting business mundane and repetitive managerial structure., Network of friends and peers new opportunities to learn skills and develop insights., Tiresome internal management and hiring structure constantly redoing the same projects that have been proven to fail very little internal innovation lack of support from local management teams., Promote internally rather than hire externally use the experience accumulated by existing staff to forecast projects and concepts that are effective and will enact positive change.
﻿Driver, Proficient in navigating through local and city traffic and GPS maps comprehensive visual memory and an excellent sense of direction, it is not a regular job that can be done consistently., 
﻿Great Place to Work!!, -Great Benefits -Great Office Spaces - Fast Paced -Smart Collaborative Teammates - Great Co-workers -Fun environment, Things are always changing, Keep doing what you're doing!
﻿Boiler Room Environment with inexperienced managers, Good leadership Uber Credit, It is still filled with incompetent managers. The work-life balance is terrible and not a friendly place for employees with families and kids. They have a generous parental leave but most people do not take advantage of it because you are looked down upon. Also when it comes to perf (performance review) you miss out on career progression if you go on parental leave. The company is not inclusive for working parents., Hire better managers with an inclusive mindset.
﻿Great for flexibility, , , 
﻿Flexibility is Key, I think that the ability that this company gives you to drive whenever you want is awesome.

﻿Great Recruiting Environment, Very collaborative teams Managers that listen Many tools available to us Reasonable KPIs Hiring Managers really want to partner with Recruiting, There is a lot of work to do here - while we do have opportunities to take time to ourselves with PTO - you can easily find yourself behind if you are not good at time management.,

﻿Great but not for me, Money was not steady enough and payouts are low in comparison to cost, Higher Pay, 
﻿Great work experience especially for temporary work, This was a 6 month temporary role but the company treats you really well. Free breakfast / lunch attendance to Uber events and the environment is fun and dynamic. The job itself was varied especially given that was temporary., For the level of the job I was doing and the size of Uber in general the pay was underwhelming., Pay more
﻿Driver with Uber, Awesome experience. Being a driver allowed for more flexibility and the team always assisted in a prompt and effective manner., The population is small in the Gold Coast would have loved the opportunity to service Brisbane as well., Keep up the good work!
﻿Data analysis decision making and real time monitoring to achieve operation's results., You work with top-of-the-fields professionals everyone is supportive and welcoming of ideas; you are encouraged to speak up whenever you see opportunities and areas for improvement. It's a very motivating environment., The stakes are high you work under pressure a lot of the time and there's definitely a need to put in extra hours to take actions in real-time (nights weekends...), Continue to promote a good environment of communication motivation and encouragement to go further and do better all the time.
﻿Don't work for Uber Eats, Choose your own hours. Can listen to music/podcasts., You're a contractor. After taxes maintenance and petrol you're making, 
﻿Ehh, , , 
﻿Meh, Super flexible Work nearly as much as you want, Poor maps Customer Service is hard to reach taxes, 
﻿Account Security and Fraud Investigation, Great Place to work in terms of competition and environment, Nothing as far as i know as the management is so friendly here, 
﻿Nice Experience as an intern, Flexible working schedule nice culture, commission-based salary. Management seldom takes care of you., 
﻿Community Operations Manager, Great place to work Great Employee benefits - Free Food Great working environment Employee Wellness Benefits Pick & Drop Cab etc etc Great Peer group - You get a chance to work with some really bright people Absolute Transparency - Atleast in the division that I work there are clear cut processes in place great visibility for the work we do. If you are good you will shine & no one can stop you similarly..., At times work can get real stressful due to the pace at which the company moves. Work-Life balance can take a hit at times due to this., None.
﻿Great learning experience for a new grad, , , 
﻿Good management, Good place to work at as they are perfect, Nothing to mention as they are really good, Keep it up and remember that hard work always pays off
﻿Uber eats, Open schedule no boss blah., Bad pay badpay bad pay, Pay better
﻿Could have been my dream job, Responsibilities creative freedom learning curve - excellent colleagues., Culture management (non-existing) work-life balance zero interest in having the employees back when legal issues came up or when harassed by management., You should think twice who you trust.
﻿Work Hard and youll get results, work/life balance make your own hours they pay out tolls, its hard to understand at first but once you learn the game its easy, 
﻿Job for driver, I'm uber cab driver is the best job..daily customer pic nd droop.., Uber company is base IT software company.. taxi .. app based .., Low to commission & Delhi rates increase
﻿Performance Marketing Manager, The company cares for your personal well being a lot more than you would care for yourself. Fast moving company with daily challenges. Keeps you thinking and moving., As the company grows bigger more administrative procedures to be done in order to make changes., Continue with the good work on ensuring inclusion of everyone in the workplace.
﻿Aggressive company with fantastic team, Really aggressive and energized team everyone here is extremely invested in doing the right thing. Very supportive culture -- quite unique for a high performance culture but everyone here will legitimately try to help their colleagues., There is definitely still some backlash / over-correction from the 2017 era -- on balance it's not awful but some things (like performance reviews) have a brutally slow process., Keep at it!
﻿Spectacular company to work for, Phenomenal start-up entrepreneur mind-set great perks absolutely wonderful people all around an inspiring energetic and exciting company to work for, There is a lot of changes the company still needs to undertake specific to how we are seen by the public and how we treat our couriers. I hope we bring in humane good employees that will work together to turn this into a great company not just from within but from outside., 
﻿Great place to work, Benefits guidance growth acceptance competitivity, NA NA NA NA NA, 
﻿Collaborative and Welcoming, Experienced employees collaborative teams mission-driven welcoming, Space... we're growing so fast it's difficult to book conference rooms when needed., Keep pushing the team in the right direction. I feel honored to be a part of the company.
﻿Tough Process Worth It to work on a great company, - Super Smart People Great Facilities Good Food & Free Snacks everyday., Is a super new company there aren´t a lot of processes but this also is good cause is more flexible., 
﻿Great onboard experience, People of all teams are always looking at how to assist you to understand how your role relates to them. The onboarding team takes a good amount of time to provide with resources and information that is very helpful when you are getting started at the company. Everyone is very open to suggestions and very supportive if you try to express your point of view., The amount of work can be a little bit overwhelming at the beginning compared to other companies, My advice would be to improve the way new hire gets all the onboarding resources prior to starting working with their teams because it helps a lot to understand how the company works.
﻿My favourite Job, Time career opportunities values safety, just they dont paid extra time, 
﻿Community support representative, Cool working environment and very helpful, Work in shifts is so bad as you can’t live as a normal person w don’t have fixed vacations,

﻿Good college job, Super flexible Chose your own hours, Not always a good time to make money, 
﻿you dont make as they said you do, you make better than minimum wage, you are killing you car mileage, 
﻿driver, decent hours free times any where, bad pay and very corrupt, 
﻿Driver, None. Don’t sign up. It’s a waste of time and money., They make you pay for all these checks. Then you drive and then without and warning and zero communication they say you can’t drive anymore. Like WTF?, Close shop or quit. You are too greedy and treat your drivers very poorly.
﻿Not a great place for a contractual employee, Understand how a global mobility business is built Fast paced Lots of opportunities to learnn, Contractual labour No job security for contractual employees Obvious difference in treatment towards contractual employees, Having contractual employees is fine treating them differently isn't.
﻿uber partner, , , 
﻿Fair rates, , , 
﻿Woot, , , 
﻿Should be better, You can pick your own hours, After the cut you make 7c a minute and 63c a mile. This is highway robbery that puts a ton of miles on your car for the payout. Be warned now your car will add a ton of miles quickly., Raise the rates for drivers this is currently close to slave labor.
﻿customer service associate, Great salary great work environment great offices and perkds, Management is a bit messy,

﻿Don't work on contract here, No Pros only Cons here, work as an external agency no company benefits, 
﻿Live in my car and drive 84 hours a week for Uber., 1st year I was profitable. 2016-2017, 2nd year I went bankrupt and got evicted 3rd year I am living in a car at the airport and can barely keep up with car maintenance insurance and payment. All of my accounts are negative and I do both Uber and Lyft. I spend nothing in food and don’t have time to apply for food stamps. The food I get is at restaurants closing when they dump trash out I try to be there., 
﻿Delivery Partner, Work on your own time, Not too many deliveries !, 
﻿Uber Eats Delivery Driver, Sometimes long waits at the restaurant delivery to apt buildings takes away from your time surge is rare and not motivating, App should show the $$$ offer before it's accepted restaurant and destination as well, 
﻿Bottom of the barrel when it comes to jobs, choosing your own schedule mostly predictable income, zero safety net whatsoever: Uber ain't got your back disregard for driver safety decreasing rates (earnings) at a whim's notice have fun talking to A.I. support!, I believe that microchipping drivers is the next logical step for Uber.
﻿Make money at your own time., Your own boss and all at your time., Puts a lot of miles on your vehicle, 
﻿Amazing work environment, Working at Uber has been an amazing opportunity for me to grow no matter how small or big your role is you will always have all the support needed to grow. - The environment is also awesome. - Great benefits. - Work ethics are so respectful and clear it guarantees to you that your voice is heard and considered., Cannot find any cons working for Uber. :D, Keep it up. Don't Change. :D
﻿A great place even this late in the game, - Smart people surround you always - Flat organizational structure - A mission you can believe in, - Getting more corporate and less startup-y - Seems to be going through a slight identity crisis, 
﻿Uber Driver, Work when you want to, Pay and misleading sign up bonus, 
﻿Do not work here!, Young vibrant team with the perks of a big company - benefits and flexible work hours. Employees get promoted fast here., The sourcing team is too large with a lot of overlap meaning that everyone is sourcing for the same talent. You become a disposable number and you can be replaced at any given time. The team here is not inclusive and management plays favorites. If you are on a contract you are expected to produce double the amount of work as full time employees and you will never see the light of day. The technical sourcing team struggles..., 
﻿Evil Stay Away, You can serve the public for intolerable wages if that's what you're looking for., If you're ready to be manipulated in just about every aspect of your life as you pick people up for this Shady company called Uber then sign right up. It is positively dangerous driving around getting routed constantly getting called on the phone getting long pickup requests suddenly not getting to clear your bonuses because you suddenly (and conveniently) stop getting trip requests right before you need to complete..., Sell your shares asap
﻿Flexible relaxed easy work for quick money, Work when you want pretty simple, finding places to park can be a hassle and the places you do find yourself putting your car sometimes can be a hazard. Can wear down your car. Sometimes the app gives bad directions.,

﻿Consultant, Young generation managers are working here, Nothing As like that everybody friendly, 
﻿They have perfected American capitalism, As a driver you can turn your app on and work for minimum wage whenever you want., The law allows them to legally misrepresent a person's potential income when working as a driver. For example if you got a trip in one direction for an hour you could potentially make $40 an hour however that happens once or twice a week and 100 hour time frame. The actual typical income is more like 10 to $12 an hour in Los Angeles., Stop cutting driver pay or a company like Juno is going to take away your ability to service your assets the Riders.

﻿Feels like a rocket ship., Incredibly smart people who believe in the mission of the company, Not a good place to “rest and vest”, Keep on crushing it :)
﻿Being your own boss, Set your own hours. Work when you want to no set days, 1099 some passengers will give you a 3-4 star even when you go above and beyond wear and tear on vehicle, 
﻿Flexible and fun, You set your work schedule., No benefits and wear on vehicle, 
﻿Great Benefits, Benefits people salary team work!, Ended program. Wish I could have stayed on longer, Need more organization and experienced management.
﻿Operations, Awesome options of mobility inside the company, Difficult to become part of Uber. Firstly hired as an external employee, 
﻿Great first job. Not ideal place to stay long term, -Free food -Great pay -Amazing people -Young vibrant atmosphere -Great work parties -Day to day work is easy, - Long shifts - No clear HR representative to address HR concerns with - No clear reasoning behind performance improvement plans for employees. Sometimes no prior warning given. - Management are sometimes disrespectful to employees and treat them like children - Progression can be difficult if you're not in with the right people., Mandatory YEARLY people management and HR training for all managers and Team Leaders. There is a clear lack of knowledge of HR and people management skills.
﻿associate, amazing work place and culture a lot to learn, according to me there is nothing, 
﻿Pro and Cons, Great potential for high pay Meet new people, Map is not reliable Constant change in app and pay rates, Get some better developers and stick to a app.
﻿Engineering-driven and fast-paced company, - Smart and qualified engineers - New management is fixing a lot of the legacy cultural and organizational issues - Engineering-driven culture - technologies are streamlined across the organization - Fast-paced environment where decisions are made quickly and allows to move fast - Focus on getting things done and allows for innovative solutions, - Tools and processes are being created and re-created as the company is still relatively new - Processes are not very established and are still being introduced - Pretty involved and lengthy performance review process - could be streamlined, You're definitely on the right path. Continue to stay focused innovate be smart and make tough decisions if needed!

﻿No UBER, , , 
﻿Driver, I like the company given job to a lots of people, Be creative and enthusiastic, 
﻿CSR, Great work environment and culture., Long shifts can make it difficult to have a routine., 
﻿Thoughtful culture challenging environment., Culture transformation is real and the focus on inclusivity is legit - not a PR stunt or stance in reaction to the company's troubled past. The work is exceptionally challenging but engaging in that its meaningful and fun., There is no way to complete all assigned and proactive work during even expanded business hours (most roles here are 60 hours or so just to keep up). I do not see this as a true con because it was expected however I feel this is a need to know going in., 
﻿41 hr/wk average $1076, Own schedule to make money though it’s all about strategy!!!, Dealing with traffic but as long as I’m in traffic with a passenger in car then I’m cool with it... because I know I’m not losing money., Better bonuses and update the damn maps in the app lol

﻿Low Earnings & Lots of Vehicle Wear & Tear, Independence; set own schedule; good Driver Ap, Low net income; wear & tear on personal auto., Increase earnings for drivers.
﻿Do something else if you can, Wear and tear on vehicle  GPS is not very accurate  customers can be demanding and rude also leave mess seldom tip  the surge often ends just as you get there, I think better pay is the main thing  when i started they said $1500 a week then it keeps dropping . Don't know why a 50 cent charge to put on my debit card  I usually had good customer service .,

Opportunities are endless. Leadership cares about doing the right thing both by our partners and riders as well as the employees. FOOD. You will barely have to go grocery shopping., As with all startups (C.O.E. is still very much a startup environment) change is constant and is not always well communicated. Not a lot of senior leadership if you end up working a night shift., Be more proactive about communicating change to the people it will be affecting the most.

﻿Great place to work, Uber is a challenging dynamic and a complete place to work. Nowadays we want to find a company which values its own employees and works hard daily to make them happy Uber is that place we´re looking for. Of course we are required to supply all the expectations but when you work happy thats not an issue., Cant find any cons at the moment., 
﻿Amazing, Good talent products and new company culture!, More consistent across-team management style, 
﻿Great place to work, Uber has a lot of world class technologies and our team members are also nice to work with so Uber is a great place to work especially it can help us grow., Revenue slow down significantly recently, 
﻿Meh, The fact you that you choose when to work., People are rancid creatures seriously., more monies.
﻿happy, changing the world every day, work lifebalance is not great, more diversity in upper management
﻿High impact work too many teams to work with, - If you want a place where the work you do impact a lot of people around the world this is the place. - Good compensation and benefits - Freedom to work from home whenever you need, - Engineering teams are scattered around the world mainly in SF and in most of your projects you will require them. That means you will need to be in late meetings constantly with them. - Teams are quite disconnected and that created a lot of duplication - deprecation of services., 
﻿Horrible. I spent more in gas looking for rides than I made., You can make your own hours and sort of do as you please., Money since your an independent contractor you supply everything and gain almost nothing, Pay your people differently. Just because you found a loophole to the minimum wage doesn't mean that it's ethically or morally right to use it.
﻿Enjoy it, Meeting new people and getting to know the city better, Not knowing where you'll take them until you pick them up, 
﻿stressful, good pay and good benefits, lack of communication bad management bro culture still exists, 
﻿Customers are inconsiarate, You can work your own hours., But you have to deal with inconsitariate customers, Consider the drivers side of story to.
﻿Lots of opportunities but lots of room for improvement, Company relied too much on this new position and took advantage of the fact that it was a "new" position- ending up with LOTS of overtime doing duties far beyond the original scope yet paying us the same as the entry level positions who reported to us!, Do what you can to show that you care about those who work hard instead of driving them away., 
﻿Drivers Are Just A Commodity, Flexibility to make a little money. It's almost a perfect job to hold you over until you find something better and once I do I am done with UBER!, The first thing you need to know about Uber is that they ultimately do not care about their drivers Why? Well it's simple; there is always someone who needs to make money and if you quit so what. You are a commodity who can be easily replaced. They will always take the riders side first unless something is documented or videoed to show otherwise. Uber is basically the Walmart of rideshare. Their goal is to pay..., Stop pretending to care about your drivers and start paying a living wage. Give the ability for drivers to be heard beyond the canned responses given for issues.
﻿Strong Cultural Norms, Uber is a work place that is putting in the effort to have strong cultural norms and take care of their employees. Breakfast and lunch are provided daily great health and wellness benefits education benefits and opportunity and monthly Uber credits. Ability to work from home; opportunity to travel., No cons overall cons. The work is hard and challenging but that is not necessarily a bad thing., 
﻿Racism and Mistreatment, Free lunch everyday at the Louisville office. Free Uber rides when traveling., The management of the self driving car program loved to hire brown people to fill a quota and fire brown people only. No matter how many mistakes white employees made they were always given second or third chances. Whereas their minority co-workers were fired on the spot. No second chances. No opportunity to defend themselves. In the 4 months I was there I witnessed several only brown people being let go. Also..., 
﻿Disband the current Riders Trip Escalations LOB, In the Downtown Area Hourly pay Good Insurance Looks good on your resume Nice perks - like reimbursements credits Outstanding benefits, Leads tendency to misinterpret or downplay certain situations due to bias Leads in this particular LOB have a conflict of interest as they have become friends with agents Lack of respect among agent/leads/team Discombobulated Leads that are there more so to entertain agents and have time pass by Agents in the Rider Trip Escalations LOB are abusive towards the policies set in place by Uber - sleep while working overtime..., Please note the cons giving here and take accountability for the agents that are currently representing the company. Agents that are content have been here solely for this reason. Not because they add value to the company. I do not need to speak to anyone 'offline' nor is there much more to dig 'deeper' in.

﻿Terrible company to work for, Work for yourself at your pace, Deal with rude customer. Uber has no idea or respect to their partners. They listen to customers more than they use their common sense. Municipalities should say no to Uber as it is putting drivers and riders at a huge safety risk., Management only listens to riders and only protecting their bottom lines and do not use their common sense or even try to listen to their partners. Very bad.
﻿DON'T DRIVE FOR UBER, Flex time in that's it!!!!, Pay really sucks!!! An example I had a trip to Englwood Cliffs NJ. I picked the person up from Hofstra Garden City NY. I made 68.71 which I really only made 5 dollars. The Breakdown: Tolls was 52.24 gas was 10.00. So I only made 6.47 to take a stranger all the way to NJ. Please learn from my mistake.,

﻿Shame on Uber, I have no pros at this time., I have been driving for Uber for 10 months and today I found out they are not reimbursing the drivers in Hampton Roads Virginia the correct amount for the tolls. I spoke to a few reps who informed me they will only correct the past 10 days. SHAME on Uber for not taking care of their drivers and doing the right thing., Take care of your driver the correct way
﻿Meh, Can work when I like Pay can be good if timing is good, People do not typically tip They got rid of surge multipliers, 
﻿Flexible Work whenever you want, Work as often or as little as you want great earning at special events and instant cash out of pay., Passengers are often drunk and the best times to earn and drive are when most people would be out having a social life., 
﻿Exploiting your own car and then they kick off as you are a piece of garbage!!!, No personal profile or personality matters! I had over 2000 rides with a rating of 4.92 out of 5.0 and my riders loved my knowledge of the city and wrote good reviews but it didn’t matter! I was no good because smb decided write fake reports on my name! Very good way to be liability free but just like everyone and everything the consequences are around the corner!, In only few months I put over 25000 miles for a brand new car the depreciation value of the car might cover the $7200 that I made??? I wonder!!, Be a bit more personal! I know it’s a billion dollars company but that’s what it will make it worth that money!
﻿Uber Eats is Great!, Fast money instant pay options tip options idiot-proof!, GPS is sometimes sloppy restaurants aren’t always on-time which delays your delivery and upsets customer. Customer support can be a headache I had to contact them 5 different times for one issue before it got resolved., PLEASE equipt customer service to better assist drivers with issues on their profiles provide a more accurate gps for locations so drivers can be timely with deliveries!
﻿Smart people Great company but they've changed..., - really smart team: they hire aggressively from IB and MBB and as such get a lot of smart people from those industries - great culture - a company at the fore of tech - interesting problems, - if you're after a startup they're not really one anymore (approaching big corporate status but only a con for some) - if you're after big corporate they're still a little unstructured (coming out of start up phase), No advice to management they know what they're doing more than I do. Still believe in Uber's mission and trajectory
﻿Part time Uber driver currently, Flexible hours extra income easy, None except for maintenance on vehicle, None needed
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule and timing and basically controlling everything else, Really bad pay and they have the worst costumers., Pay your drivers more.
﻿No support, nothing Uber is horrible, As an Uber Driver you almost no support. Been with Uber as a nightmare. Don't do it, 
﻿Enjoy freedom comparing to normal Chinese culture company, -can control working hour by myself -majority of FTC are nice -free snacks & beverage -casual wearing -good to learn about start-up -good office environment, -uncertainty about contact length vague opportunity to become FTE -some FTE are selfish not helpful towards junior members -uncertainty about company future development in local market -unstable company strategies. It changes all the time. -few FTE being FTE just because they enter here early instead of their abilities.,

﻿Excellent College Job, After working in retail for the first three years of college I wanted my weekends back for my senior year and decided to try Uber out. It was the first year that they entered into the Austin market and it was still a little unknown but my only chance to work around a crazy college student schedule. The experience couldn't have been better! I worked the hours I needed to for my schedule and was still able to have a somewhat..., Fluctuating and unpredictable income. Negative effects on driver for surge pricing., 
﻿Stay away from the social media team, Good benefits nice people paychecks, The social media team is pretty clueless and the cluelessness leads to unnecessary drama., Fix it
﻿"Helping the community", I believe uber is providing job opportunities that can be beneficial to alot of people. For example if you already have employment and you need extra cash to cover your bills. This is very advantageous. Or if you are in between jobs or a career this could be the very thing to pull you through. Thumbs up to uber on this side., On the other hand this job opportunity is only available to certain members of society. If you have a back ground check and you have any type of law violations regardless of what they are for. You can not work for uber. This is not only a typ of discrimination but is not fair. Lets think about it for a moment. What about those individuals who have not been in trouble for a certain period of time and have changed there..., Give people who had some set backs in there lives a chance. The problems that i have heard from uber were from people who did not have a record. Just a chance.
﻿Data Scientist Role in Uber, Infra is well built. Lots of support from Eng team which is easy to deal with. Get exposure to many business problems from different internal clients., Pay is on average in Tech in Bay area, 
﻿Driver, *Flexible hours *Being your own boss *Learning to manage time and money, *Not always busy *Industry only busy at certain times and places *May have to deal with unruly people., Give more commission back to drivers.

﻿Excellent, Values Culture Ethics Friendly No dress Code, There's nothing bad about Uber., Nothing
﻿A company that moves people, Working at Uber you feel that you have been select to a revolution to change the way people move in the world. Just some of good aspects are: - Talented people - Engineering challenges at scale that actually impacts people lives - Startup energy even after tremendous growth so far - Compensation & Benefits are one of the best in the region, Company is still growing fast so you are always keeping up with the pace., 
﻿Greenlight Hub, - culture - experience - opportunities, - computer based - front desk, - keep improving!
﻿good pay, , , 
﻿Evil evil place, The salaries are decent. It's great if you're a white guy., Toxic culture. Promotions not based on qualifications or performance., 
﻿Best pay of the bunch, They give great pay (bonus times are awesome you can make a lot with little to no effort). Super flexible time you do it when you want/can., Sometimes you won't get any requests and the app doesn't give you an idea of where there are more deliveries being requested. Additionally because it's more expensive for the customer than other services tips are rare., 
﻿Picking and dropping off customers, Good and fast money! Flexibility Own boss, Car mileage increases Car expenses fuel oil change maintenance, Increase rates for drivers
﻿Uber, I can make my own schedule, People throwing up in your car, 
﻿It's OK, Freedom to work when you want. Greenlight hub are good folks., Pay is too low for using your own car. Rides are too infrequent. Uber navigation is not good causing issues with passengers., 
﻿I loved everything about this company. Easy fast reliable. I enjoyed working with them., Easy payment and also the pay is great., Wear and tear on your vehicle., Upper management should not only be involved with people that work there. But also the drivers themselves.
﻿Good flexibilitt, , , 
﻿Decent pay, Good pay during special events and early mornings, Inconsistent pay terrible rating system rate cuts, Raise the fares and stop offering so many recruitment bonuses. Uber works better when there are fewer drivers because you get a smaller more professional workforce.
﻿Uber can be rewarding depending on how much you put into it., -A base rate on mileage and time traveled from merchant to customer -Easy app interface -Solid pay, -Delivery driver support is hard because the current support line is set up for Uber drivers not delivery drivers., Uber needs to figure out a way to account for bad weather and road conditions. Create a support team for Uber Eats so that the drivers have a way to contact you.
﻿Operations Consultant at Uber, , , 
﻿It has SO much potential to be a GREAT place to work!, -/+ "Flex" work and "unlimited" PTO - Disorganized managers/managers who lack experience - Managers play favorites - HR I would have given a one-star rating if not for the amazing potential of this company! Uber could really go places. But the company is its own worst enemy. Quality work is not rewarded. It's not even encouraged. The focus is on how fast can you turn out a product; not how good of a product..., Hire experienced competent managers be honest with your employees encourage outside ideas (and don't stay stuck in the "not-invented-here" syndrome) treat all employees as close to the same as reasonably possible and do what top companies do to engage employees: allow them to do the work they are capable of doing. Perks are great but perks are not culture. Don't confuse the two which you seem to do now., 
﻿Nice company overall but some things should be fixed., -It is a great company with a great global corporate culture. -Visionary firm oriented towards to future. -Very innovative and high-quality internal tools which make working at Uber enjoyable. -Top-notch IT equipment. -All Hands allow different team to get together and get a feeling on the progression of the company. -People are very nice. -Possibility to liaise with people from different offices. -The facilities..., -Elitist and somewhat nepotistic environment in the Paris office with several hires coming from the same schools/promotions (ex SciencesPo HEC) or being friends with current employees. Very evident in the marketplace team for example. -In some teams management is too directive and not listening to suggestions prompting people to leave. -Limited progression chances in some Paris teams leading to high turnover...., Uber is a great company but management in the Paris office should fix the issues above.
﻿A good place to start, Freedom to work whenever you want, No benefits or discounts. Lack of growth or progression, Give drivers more freedom to choose who they want to pick up

﻿Community Operations Manager, Everything its filled with opportunities to do great job., We are in the transition phase., None we are on the right path
﻿Work whenever but you pay for it, Work whenever Travel around the city, VERY LOW pay per order Even if you drive a Honda Civic +20% of your pay goes into gas Horrible traffic Extreme wear and tear on car, Step up the profits for drivers. We’re working under minimum wage after considering all factors such as gas and car maintenance.
﻿Best time so far, I think it really depends on the team you join. I was super lucky with my line of business and the people I work with on a daily basis.

﻿RIDESHARE DRIVER TAKES 2nd LOOK, At this time NO pros as a driver, Lacks living a pay rate Too many corp changes to the platform pay cuts transparency no choices other than accept corp changes without any input to the changes before or after a change is made. Safety has become an issue for everyone driver & passager, Why bother they only care about IPO
﻿Expert, Excellent benefits including Uber cash for personal use (ride share of Uber eats), None so far. Happy to be here, Keep up the good work!!!
﻿It's not bad if you like people. Make sure it works for you. Look into it., It's up and down. I worked in San Francisco Bay Area. There is a tun of traffic. One day I made over $500 but I worked for 19hrs. It's a grind but if you work during the right times of days. and make the incentives it can pay off., Dangerous on the roads! Be careful. You are the boss. Get your ducks in a row. Track miles track income pay taxes and be safe. If you aren't covered depending on the details of an incident Uber may or may not pay for it., 
﻿Easy flexible work, Flexible Easy Decent money Meet cool people, Might randomly get a poor review and have no idea why. Only happened once but it was frustrating., 
﻿Best Company I have ever worked for, Solid people lean company very little internal politics and beurocracy Open source friendly good compensation great management everyone optimistic about the future of the company, workload might be more than other older tech companies, 
﻿So far so good, Pick my own hours. Pick my location/area to work., Keeping the car clean is HARD especially when it's snowing, 
﻿Great for Extra Cash, You can make ok money and it’s great for networking., Put too many miles on your car., Pay attention to your employees’ complaints.
﻿Great opportunity, Great opportunity to grow within the field of Operations, There are more positives than negatives, 
﻿Great place to solve global problems, - global projects - complex problems to solve - relevance with society - talented people - better work/life balance, - culture has changed from growth at all costs to very corporate - not as innovative and fast (things move slow now) - most of the OGs are gone - senior leadership in Ops and Product was not that strong - people team needs to improve - needs better comp, 
﻿Uber Eats - Sydney Head Office, Still building the corporate governance needs more structure in regards to career development, Hiring and expansion decisions should be managed locally, 
﻿The company has not given a raise to its drivers in 5 years., The overhead is stifling. After being short changed by the xchange leasing program now I am expected to pay for all maintenance. This is after having the car for two years. Most leases usually extend their warranty to three years. Basically Uber does not care about it's drivers. It's dumping 20 million dollars a month into autonomous cars that wont work because Uber's proprietary navigation software is wonky., Take care of your drivers. Happy drivers happy riders happy riders means you will have more clients and you won't have to rely on private investors to keep you afloat., 
﻿Excellent, , , 
﻿Flexible pay for flexible hours, - Make your own schedule - Drive your own car - Take days off exactly when you need to, - Easy to fall out of a routine due to no specific work schedule this can and will effect the amount of money you bring in., 
﻿Great way to make extra money, Fun driving passengers and doing deliveries. Good pay during peak hours or holidays/events.

So many phone calls (50+) and emails (100+) over the last 2 years and the issues still happen. how does it make sense to have me get one order at a time when a restaurant has 10 orders? also how does it make sense for me to pick up an order from that restaurant that just got placed and not the one that was placed an hour ago. No incentives to pick up the order that's been...
﻿Driving people from place to another, Know the city restaurants shopping mall and different area, Opportunity to meet different people, Good luck

﻿Pretty good, , , 
﻿Flexible but They Keep Finding Ways to Gouge Drivers' Pay, Decent side gig most of the time. I preferred nights which made for less congestion around Seattle area and learned how to master different personalities that were often intoxicated. I enjoyed talking with riders and getting people safely home or alternate destinations. Sometimes Tips were amazing!, Uber consistently found ways to cut further into driver pay. I used to get QUEST bonuses but now they are only for drivers on a certain level (those who put in alot of hours). The market became saturated with drivers and suddenly where I lived and was usually able to get local passengers....all these newbies were around in my night shift! Wear and Tear on car and gas!, Give the part timers a chance to get bonuses! Offer discounts on repairs like brake jobs so drivers can get the work done and pass their next inspection! Don't just reward the $$$ numbers but the drivers who give high customer service to a myriad of people and personalites!
﻿Redline, You build a fun and green product. And learn from skilled peers how in general to build scalable and robust systems., Overworking harassment mismanagement its all true. Add to that compensation that is significantly skinnier than the competition no 401k match vacation only at discretion of manager etc., Ditch the nightclub atmosphere. The new CEO is a positive change but not enough.
﻿Make a lot of money. For UBER, Terrible pay considering the money i make for UBER. UBER gets more than 60% of what the rider pays in some trips., The worse thing about driving for Uber is that they don’t share the profits. They pay the driver for time and distance and make a different logic to charge the rider. The more short is the trip more money Uber gets proportionally to the rider payment. Uber send requests really far away from the driver without the appropriate payment for that. The pick up at the airport is a joke. The waiting area in Grand Rapids-MI is..., 
﻿Negative experience, Got some good experience while there., Horrible company culture and leadership., 
﻿Average pay is low, Your own time and meet other people, Long pick up with no or little pay long pick up with short ride and no compensation from Uber poor support due to lack of understanding US by hiring outside US reps payment calculation is not accurate., Treat drivers better if you want to market your business as available anytime than you should consider better compensation for long pick up and short rides. Otherwise soon or later drivers will find ways to avoid these and your reputation will hurt. Because no ones like to operate with a loss.
﻿Drive Uber and Go Broke, Flexible schedule. See new faces and places., Pay sucks. Car get used. up. Self-employment tax., Proper compensation for time labor and vehicle.
﻿Quality Analyst manager, Great environment and benefits. Very modern., Slow growth No career development., 
﻿Great Company maturing fast, Young energetic and incredibly capable team., It is losing the start-up charm and becoming a regular corporation., Don't forget what made Uber successful.

I get hit by someone on a bike they scar my front bumper and there is nothing the insurance can do. Get ran off the road by some stupid teenage girl who decides it's okay to do 80 in the middle lane during a snowstorm but where's uber?, TAKE A LOT BETTER CARE OF DRIVERS STUPID
﻿Good job if you put in the hours, , , 
﻿UBEREATS Driver quests gone, NONE without the quest driving only favoring UBER, No quests=No bonus cash you are driving for free practically in favor of UBER. Wear and tear on car plus the gas you are driving that day to fill your tank. Not worth it., Bring back the quests.
﻿We do the right thing period., the most great place to work ever people oriented and focused in our development, young company some process are not aligned, The management team always shows empathy and highly disposition to do the right thing!
﻿Driver for Uber, Flexible hours good pay fits any schedule., Since an independent contractor you have no benefits., 
﻿Uber Greenlight Hub, - Supportive Management - Constant change which made it pretty fresh week to week, Due to the fast-paced and ever changing landscape people would often not come in for their scheduled shift causing there to be a great deal more work to do for the few staff that were present.,

﻿Very good stuff driving people, , , 
﻿Going Downhill, Set your own schedule and meet some cool people at times., everything else now. Used to be a nice gig to make good money but now it's garbage., treat your drivers like human beings and not trash.

﻿Worst customer service but good money if you have no choice, Work om your own time, Horrible management No help when you need it Bad HR, 
﻿Work at your own time!, It was a great experience being an uber driver since you can work whenever you felt like., People who cannot handle their alcohol and throwing up in your car or being belligerent., 
﻿Managers are not supportive, You get food and incentives. No work pressure., Employees are treated as slaves as managers don't listen to issues as critical as bullying at work or SM., No use.

﻿A genius concept, Perfect for in between jobs or as a side gig. You can work as much or as little as you want and have 100% control of your schedule, You put a lot of miles on your car especially if you work full time. It can catch up to you pretty quick. You burn through a lot of gas as well, Keep doing what you're doing

﻿Great place to grow, *Great development environment *Your colleagues are brilliant *Good benefits, * As a fast-growing company sometimes life/work balance is not ideal. But nothing extreme it also depends on your role, 
﻿Uber is an amazing place to do your best work. Loads of opportunity building the future of mobility., - Exciting future in the making - Smart and mindful leadership - Not your basic big tech company - Move fast make impact, - Crowed office space till new HQ in 2020 - Room for improvement on cross collaboration, 
﻿Amazing work environment!, I have found an incredible balance between a global company and the autonomy impact and creativity of a startup culture. There's a lot of transparency. You feel very valued as a member of the team., It's a bit hard to understand the company structure at first., 
﻿Uber, Able to work and earn as much as I want daily. Being outside. Meeting new different people daily, Lots of where and tear on my car, 
﻿Ubereats, You can drive when you want., People dont tip you have to wait at restaurants for food without getting paid.,

﻿Well rounded experience, Working cross-functionally on large brands direct impact strategy-driven role, High stress open concept work environment difficult to navigate career pathing, Good supportive management but lacking in the ability to make changes at city level. Have a large responsibility - kind of understaffed
﻿It's really a great thing to do in free time, , , 
﻿Low retention of talent, Long work hours and very very low compensation. The place is chaotic and they do no appreciate the talent that they hire., Do better, 
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿There's a reason Uber depends so much on new drivers, Flexible schedule car insurance while online. It has had potential to be a great job but it seems like all of that is going away., Work environment support from company pay safety when driving (due to not knowing where you are going and driving at times when drunk driving is high) long term stability of company shady business practices not being transparent with drivers and passengers., Businesses are all made on maximizing profits while minimizing expenses. I get that but Uber needs to come up with a solution to pay drivers fairly for the work that they do while maximizing profits. If you stay greedy you won't last long term. Everything that made uber profitable for drivers is slowly being taken away new drivers will drive for a little while but eventually you will run out especially once they start...
﻿Great Place, , , 
﻿good work place, good managers and contemporary offices, dosent have scope for promotion, 
﻿Good benefits Bad Pay, Special locations get a fully stocked fridge cabinets of snacks and a soda fridge. Others you get compensated for $10 for your lunch. You also get Uber Credits each month if you're full time and the benefits are amazing as well. You get dental vision health mental maternity etc., You will be underpaid be expected to deal with very difficult Uber drivers who are technologically challenged and don't understand basics of life. You will also be promised a bonus structure that really isn't anything and you only get it every 3 months. You'll also be asked to go above and beyond and help do your lead's jobs for no compensation when they are short staffed. (which is often), Pay your employees more for all the things you expect of them. Benefits do not equal pay especially in somewhere like Los Angeles where the living cost is so high.
﻿Pretty easy job not suited for people who like to be challenged, Lots of small perks and good health insurance. They give you free uber rides at the beginning of the month., Things are changing as far as culture. Its not terrible but certain things are irritating., 
﻿Expert, Flexible time for vacations permissions, Poor opportunities career very low quality facilities Unpleasant work environment, Patience
﻿Terrible job terrible people are using the app even worst support service., Get far away from this terrible company!, Get far far away from this so called company!, Instead of paying your software engineers tons of $ to destroy further app better invest in drivers support service while they are giving rides to terrible people around!
﻿Mixed, Flexible No Boss Have/rent a car always Get to learn the ways around the city very quick, Hard to find parking in NYC High insurance/rent Depreciation hits hard dealing with drunk people constant risk of getting tickets/crashes very low earnings/rides per hour for the TLC cap on cars (more cars on the road than usual now), 
﻿In my opinion, I love being able to explore new places and meet new people. No day at work is ever the same., Driving full time requires a lot of car maintenance and gas money., 
﻿Great place to work for self motivated., , , 
﻿Uber slave, Make your own schedule, Too many to list! If you like losing money to make corporate America money go for it! If you add up all the expenses and how much uber steals from its partners it's not worth it! In three years I have received 2 pay cuts? If you want to do this be prepared to be frustrated with uber taking up to 2/3 of your fare! Bottom line do your research in your area. Ask other drivers currently driving for uber. I would advise people..., Pay your partners fairly and constantly Have your priority support in America for north America drivers. Stop stealing so much from our fares
﻿It is good, Becouse we can work when we want, Nothing everything perfect keep working, I think you should care your delievery driver

﻿Very poor pay . To many miles on your car. I would NEVER recommend doing this job!, No boss. If you only need to make 50$ extra a week as a supplement to your regular job it's doable., Everything!!!!!! Uber is a scam! They know wages don't keep up with the cost of living. They know a lot of people have bad work environments and they take advantage of that. Greediest most repulsive organization I've ever been affiliated with!, SHARE SOME OF THE WEALTH!!!!
﻿Free Medical Monthly Wellness Credits Uber Credits AND Fertility Benefits!, Uber understands Comp beyond base pay ... Flexible time off free medical coverage Uber Credits Wellness Credits and even Fertility benefits! Of course the stock options and bonus potential are great. It is awesome to see a company thinking about the full picture of an employee's needs. Look around at other traditional brands in banking retail logistics and you are not going to find these awesome "living" perks...., Not a con if you enjoy what you do  but there is ALOT of work to do and the pace is intense. It's an exciting busy feeling but also easy to get sucked into a 12 hour work day and not realize it., 
﻿greenlight expert, Everything is handled and delivered perfectly except hoped for a more solid training., one on one training before able to interact with Uber partners., ask new employee if they're ready for their first interactions rather that just figuring it out driver notices the discomfort.

﻿GREAT JOB, - Monthly Uber Credits - Catered Lunch - Unlimited Snacks, - Management has favorites,

﻿So Far So Great, Great team with interesting problems to solve at large scale. Lot's of autonomy to work on the projects where you can maximize impact. Leadership team is open honest and inspiring., It has become a large company very quickly so some of the staff that have been here since Uber's early startup days are having trouble adapting to the inevitable shifts (process compliance etc.). Some of the leadership that have been here a long time seem slightly out of their element., 
﻿LOVE the flexible schedule bonuses exploring my city and meeting nice people!, Flexible schedule good pay fun meet nice people explore the city., Depending on the season and time of day it can really slow down., I don't have a manager!
﻿Company needs to start promoting work-life/balance, -Benefits -Perks (Food Uber Credits Gym Reimbursements), No work-life/balance extremely long hours and weekend work. I understand the business is at the forefront of the market with innovation and the IPO approaching but in order to keep employees post-ipo this needs to be reinforced., Learn to prioritize expand head count for certain departments giving employees time to breathe.

﻿Good for passing time, Self employed choose your hours, Money is not as good as it sounds, Give drivers incentives

﻿Rideshare, Work when you want any time day or night. Instant cash out payment., I dont like using my own car. The rental car service should be a little cheaper and should be made available in more than just select areas and cities., All drivers who didn't receive the promised sign up bonuses no mater of the city the drove in or still drive in should receive that promised promotion.. those promotions and promise sign ups are what cought my eye and made me want to sign up. Well unfortunately I got stiffed out of mine bonus because Uber wasn't running a promotion in my city at the time. That's so unfair. I did everything on my end to meet the number...

﻿A disgrace of a company, Competitive Salary and Secondary Benefits, The culture is very unpleasant. A previous review used the term cutthroat and it is. Quite male dominated and many of the legacy old guard refuse to change. HR seem to be a necessary evil for the business. In the 10 months there I experienced myself becoming extremely unhappy. The Recruitment process gave me a very different idea of what I was joining. That should have been the first warning sign.... the inexperience..., Listen to your employees! This atmosphere is becoming inreasingly unpleasant and it is going to become impossible for you to attract experinced talent.
﻿Fluctuating pay, Manage your own schedule, There should be a base salary to compensate for wait times and sometimes after expense you make only 12/hr even though Uber claims 25/hr., Treat your drivers more like employees and make em happy with benefits and a systematic way to channel their ideas and feedback for improvements
﻿Best Job I have ever had, They care about my work life balance and the benefits astonish me everyday, Nothing I have experienced yet, 
﻿Uber Knoxville, Good money early morning, I live to far from Knoxville, Advertise more
﻿Work /work balance, they revamped their salary and equity structure once employees started leaving amidst all of the self-inflicted turmoil in 2017. so some employees received hefty adjustments upward to align with the bottom of the market equivalent bands. early employees were able to keep what became a generous (generous because of non-retro changes that were made) Uber credit benefit to be used for rides & meals. you get to work..., Zero work /life balance. Internal politics are rife with domain protection and territory management in order to achieve career growth. Total focus on individual achievement and some toxic team dynamics depending on which org you work in. Fringe benefits (meals Uber credits (un)limited vacation facilities training opportunities) are 2nd class. Institutional sexism and ageism with less and less transparency as..., Continue towards IPO so current and former employees can exit and move on.
﻿Great work... but never ending and feels like rat race, Great work but don't expect or treat as career., Too many drivers complain and some passengers are horrible, Good job! Wish there wasn't so much change in the program sometimes feel a little lost or like a cog.

﻿Best company to work at., Everything from the perks to the work environment is the best yet, Location. A little hard to commute to., 
﻿Uber driver, If you need to make money until you get something better, They don’t care for the drivers, 
﻿Horrible horrible... I wish I could give it a minus five..., On your own schedule. Day and Night. Can choose any location to start from., You work almost for free spending your life and car for nothing. Like a slave., You must raise the driver earns and lower your damn all sort of fees which are now in the range of 25%-50% of the rider's payment. Someday the majority of uber drives will go on strike.
﻿Great job to develop customer service skills and they have an instant-pay option., Independent schedule working at your own time. Moreover instant-pay opportunities are given., When delivering for Uber Eats service they do not take into account that some streets in your city are closed so you have to call the client which most of the time will rate you poor for arriving a little bit late. The rating reviews are not fair with the employee. Finally most of the people do not leave a review for the driver nor the businesses do., Review their rating review.
﻿Could be better, , , 
﻿Terrible Support for Employees, I had to switch phone numbers which disallowed me access to my app. Every time I tried to update my new account information to register my phone number it asked to send a confirmation to my OLD phone number which I no longer have access to! It never gave me an option to validate my new number via email. To make things more frustrating I could not for the life of me find a phone number to talk to anyone who could help...., Instacart was entirely helpful when it came to Shopper Happiness and assisting their employees. I always had a way to talk to someone when I needed help with the app or anything. Not having an accessible line of support for drivers when we can't get into the app is a great way to lose your workers. Fast., 
﻿Chauffer, Flexibility non micro managing and good working environment., Low pay and bad partner support., 
﻿Cool Place to work at, - Challenging problems - A lot of autonomy and room for self-development, - Once something is shipped it's very hard to find time to clear up any debt as the business won't prioritise that over new feature development. Things are generally improving as the CTO is pushing eng-wide initiatives which aim to fix that., 
﻿Not a bad place to work, Paid weekly  has instant pay so if your running short before paydag, If you make change to banking info it can stop your pay for 48 to 72 hours and you will have to change your password and update your bank info cause the system thanks you were hacked, Fix where people can call and straighten it out insted of having to wait till the security team gets ahold if then
﻿Social Media copyright Marketing team, Good for know people around the world, I don't recommend work here, 
﻿It's fine, Make own hours Same day withdrawal, Service dog frauds Drunk friends Late late nights are dangerous, A customer service failure hardly warrants a lifetime ban. Maybe a week is appropriate for first time offenses. If you're not going to have the driver prosecuted you have no business banning them for life over a pitbull.
﻿Arrogant and greedy, They look at their employees like they are disposable and like they don’t matter Uber eats has horrific customer service makes their restaurants loose money have no concept of competitive pricing Political nightmare Pay should be better especially if they think they are Facebook. Facebook pays their employees a competitive salary. You think an hourly wage of $19.50 in downtown San Francisco is acceptable? You..., Get over yourselves.,

Not safe in some areas You have to deal with rude and sometimes drunk customers You are constantly being evaluated with your rating which is often not fair, 
﻿Uber is okay but it could be better, You can work almost wherever and whenever you want and set your own hours. I get to meet a lot of people from a lot of places.... I like to drive ...., They take around 35-50% of what the riders pay and we don't get paid much... We have to supply our own vehicles maintain them and keep them clean and pay insurance .....For all that we do they don't even pay minimum wage and they consider us independent contractors which makes it so they don't have to offer any type of benefits etc....., same as above give us more pay for more and encourage us more

I had the app glitch on me and the paths they give you sometimes are for cars. I have ended up on high ways I was not allowed on and was yelled at by traffic officers that i was not allowed there.

﻿Waste of time and effort, The only thing I would say is putting your on schedule and you can quick cash. Only a temporary job., You’re always under stress and the company takes too much of every ride you take. Sometimes it is above %60 of what the riders pay.

﻿COE, Growth opportunities are wonderful here., Rational shifts are not so healthy., Offer a better pay
﻿Opportunity to learn, work with very smart people always an opportunity to learn great work life balance and culture, minimal pay not valued by executive leadership, treat your talent as if they are talented and valuable rather than dispensible
﻿Uber Eats, No passengers only you and the food., Have to leave your car in the street a lot at the risk of getting fined. Have to deliver food to door many of the times which makes things very difficult for you as a driver., Make customers come downstairs to pick up the food! In cities like DC there is barely any parking; to expect drivers deliver food to door is selfish.
﻿Uber Eats, - Free Food - Great Culture - Beautiful Office - Awsome People, - Low pay - Fast paced not enough structure - inefficiencies in work management, - Pay Employees more give shares have better benefits
﻿Senior Software Engineer, Great engineers. People are passionate., Management is weak bad politics., Keep a flat organization.
﻿Operations Associate, - Work satisfaction is great as a lot of responsibilities and decision making is given to the employee - Employee benefits is excellent and stands out compared to other similar companies, - The first few months will be hard to adjust to such a fast paced environment - Might face stress due to overload of work during select weeks, 
﻿not bad, , , 
﻿Challenging Inspiring Promising., Team work; Access to great experiences and people; humbling to truly stand on the shoulder of Masters., Competition; odd contracts; uncertainty. There is an uneven pace to it all but it bodes well with its centric office location. In essence your job will be varied and you will need to wear many technical hats; if you cannot learn on the job do not apply to this company. If you are used to having everything served on a silver platter you will be sorely ridiculed in many more (meta) ways than one., The hiring process is failing we are clearly not getting the best. Somewhere along the line there is someone not doing their job in filtering out the truly good and the mediocre leet-code caste of sheep; useless to the bone.
﻿Unprofessional, Unprofessional a total disgrace they need bigg improvements, Unprofessional cant say anything good about these people, Better customer service everyone needs to be the dame page the call center is very frustrating

﻿They take your cut little by little, Make your own time sometimes you have great conversations with the riders, They do not take care of you or your car expenses are more than earnings, pay the drivers hourly and background check them most of them do NOT know how to drive and are dangerous to others.
﻿Good opportunity, 1. Work Culture is very friendly 2. Exposure 3., 1. Less chances to become full time employee, na

I've been in the service industry 4 over 30 years I know how to treat customers and most people do not even recognize good service because they never had good service nor do they even know what good service is cuz they have never experienced any before. ( generally speaking)., Minimum wage is all you make when you calculate hours spent driving gas tires lights mufflers brakes windshield replacement depreciation of car tax and the list goes on and on and on and on you probably make about $3 net. I put a hundred thousand miles on my car in 2 years and the depreciation of a $20000 car is probably $10000 or so. whatever you make in a year just subtract 5000 dollars plus gas( $5000 and..., Guarantee an hourly wage that should be at least +$15.00!!!NET!!!
﻿The benefits of being an Uber Driver., , , 
﻿RIP OFF, IF (and this is a BIG IF) you can get deliveries in a surging area you can make some decent side money. Only if it is surging at 1.5 or 1.6 though and that is RARE!!!!, You spend more on gas and vehicle maintenance that what you earn. The delivery fees have jumped way up but drivers get left working for peanuts. Not worth the time! You can at most get two deliveries in an hour and maybe make 7 to 10 dollars IF you are lucky...(I was rarely ever lucky), Provide better driver support when they have to call in. Driver Support Services are a joke you never receive support that is actually helpful. There is always a long hold when trying to get support. Instead of pocketing all the profits why not invest in the company and make it worth a DAMN!!!

﻿Driver, Can select your own schedule, Doesn’t pay nor treat drivers well, More bonuses better communication with drivers
﻿Not worth driving Uber in NYC, Networking. You have great opportunities to speak to many different kinds of people and sort of endorse yourself for your own business purposes or just have great conversation with people from all over the world., It's not enough. The percentage Uber takes from fares is depressive for the driver. The Uber rates are extremely cheap and the pay overall is just discouraging. It doesn't even make sense. They even diminished the surge pricing which was the only way you could make a decent amount for a trip. Overall it just isn't fair., Think of yourself as a driver. Would you go to JFK from Hells Kitchen on a weekday at 6pm (rush hour) for $33 (including the toll) a trip that'll most likely take you 1 hour and 10 minutes without having a guarantee to get a trip back from the airport? I don't think you would. There are people who are raising families living in one of the most expensive cities in the world. Its only right to at least give the proper...
﻿Best job ever., -Work your own hours -Tips -Little to no interaction with people (introvert benefit) -Get paid to drive and listen to music or audiobooks -Take as many days off as you'd like take a 3 week vacation or call in sick for 3 months and there will be no issues. -YOU ARE YOUR OWN BOSS - SOO MANY MORE, Not very many that I can think of. Maybe that other Uber drivers complain too much? LMAO!!!, A bit more pay would be cool but I generally make 12-25 an hour so not bad so far...

﻿Driver, You can work as much or little as you want, They don’t care about you or your job. Just a number., What management?
﻿Good in benefits, The benefits are great the vacations are unlimited you get stocks they pay for the gym and the cellphone., In LatAm still a lot of women discrimination especially in higher roles. You can't be yourself as some people can take you as intimidating or too shy to fit in the culture.,

﻿Driver, As a very temporary gig it will provide cash flow due to the nature of depreciation. But that will eventually come back to bite you when you have to oil changes and new tires at least twice as often.., You will not make even minimum wage. In the DC area they are currently paying 24 cents a minute and 64 cents a mile. And those amounts are only applicable when you a passenger in the car. You are not paid anything between rides or when going to pick up a rider. It doesn't take rocket science to figure out that you won't make much of anything. IRS allows the 54.5 cents a mile deduction for the use of your car. If..., There is a reason why the average driver only drives for about 6 months before moving on.
﻿Good pay/decent perks/culture wasn’t awesome, They paid well had good perks., The culture was kind of blah. Felt like constant competition and butting heads between Uber 1.0 and Uber 2.0, 
﻿Don't plan long term, Your own hours Extra money in your pocket, You make less the longer you work with them You don't get to see the rating of who you are picking up, When I started off everything was great. As guaranteed I would make 75% of the fare Uber would take 25%. Then they added their promotion of giving x amount of rides in x amount of time for a bonus even better. After about a year though everything went down hill. I noticed I was making less money while riders were paying more money and Uber's "service fee" only got higher and higher. The 75/25 split no longer existed...

﻿Good job if you dont mind making less than minimum wage, Flexible Meeting cool people doing cool things, Plan to put a lot of wear and tear/miles on your car if you dont live in a city and to consistently make about $3/hour.  I'm glad they fired me because it took a lot and didn't give much.  I had 2 bad reviews out of a hundred and they fired me by email and without consideration for my side of the story. It seems like all that needs to happen is a few people call to complain and you're gone with another warm body..., Stop treating drivers like they are cars that  can be turned on and off and junked at your discretion.  Maybe take a different angle because Uber is getting a bad reputation among drivers and passengers and you're just one corporate scandal away from losing your alpha status. Know that I will be watching that 60 minutes with my popcorn and root beer laughing manically.

﻿Exciting and Ambitious Company with Intense Work Environment, Iconic and ubiquitous company having huge impact on communities globally in ridesharing and beyond If you're willing to dive in there are many projects/opportunities to make a meaningful contribution Internal entrepreneurial/ownership culture means no one is resting on his/her laurels or waiting for others to take action Dara and the executive leadership team are top-notch, Culture change away from earlier dysfunction is real but incomplete Processes can be unclear unstated or non-existent which can lead to poorer coordination or visibility into what's happening and who is/should be involved, Maintain commitment to culture change and "adult" leadership Incentive and reward development of sustainable processes and systems that allow the company to move quickly while maintaining transparency inclusivity and compliance
﻿Great for big cities, Income is only limited to the time you want to put into it, can be hard to make enough to live on in small towns, 
﻿Marketing intern, Great working environment brainstorming  good ideas, Not enough resource to share around small teams, 
﻿JUMP Field Operations Manager Review, Fair compensation Great benefits Engaging work environment Cultivating work environment, Struggling work/life balance Less than ideal workspace, I appreciate the feedback from management. They have been supportive and engaged with my professional growth and have allowed me to pursue skills that will ultimately help me contribute further to Uber's mission.
﻿Cairo/egypt, I love this job so that it will be comfortable and profitable, Car consumption is only in the checker, I prefer to advise me
﻿Not worth your time, Waste gasmileage depreciation and time for few bucks...lol i am not doing this anymore... i drive 15 blocks to pick up the food then drive 6 miles to deliver and only for $4.82!!!! Lol this is a joke, Start paying drivers better and charge customers more, 
﻿Uber Brisbane, Not many to think of. You can work when you want but it's no use if you make so little money for your time., Extremely low wages. Once you factor in all costs. It's much lower than a junior working in Mc Donalds. High commision rates. 27.5 inc tax Long wait times. Slow support in regards to approving documents., 
﻿Uber Eats Delivery Driver -- Great Supplemental Income With Its Problems, -Ability to go online and offline whenever you want (vs DoorDash's scheduling system) -OVERALL fair compensation for constant deliveries depending on what market/city you deliver in but overall good pay for the easy work that is asked -Flexible pay options (weekly with no fee or instant with an instant cash out fee) -Most connections with restaurants and customers have little margin for error making it easy even for..., -Time and effort driving to a restaurant is unpaid no matter how far you have to drive. If you deliver in slower areas/periods or the driver count is low you may get a 30 minute delivery which involves 20 minutes to the restaurant unpaid then to drive 0.5 miles to someone's house and yielding only a few dollars -Business can be very unpredictable. Lots of down time in the Illinois south suburbs market. There can..., -If you're truly adamant on NOT paying drivers for time and mileage TO the restaurant (same pay if I was in the parking lot or if I was 30 minutes away) then create an option for drivers to set a time/mile range where they will only receive trips within that radius.

﻿Great place to learn provided you can keep up with the pace!, - Lots of intelligent people working here. - Great perks for full timers - including free breakfast and lunch buffet spread everyday - Love how everyone hustles to get things done and no one really draws lines here. Everyone goes beyond and above his/her jobscope to get things done., - Lack of transparency sometimes. - There's a line drawn between full timers and contract staffs. Etc. for some of our meetings or offsite events it will only be extended to full timers.

﻿Lead Expert, Difference b/w full-timer and contract, Please don't hate Contract employees, 
﻿Great Work Environment but Underpaid, Great work / life balance (come in at 9:30am leave at 5:45pm) awesome monthly Uber credits to be used for Rides and / or Eats chill work environment (casual dress) hear from the CEO each week surrounded by brilliant co-works (ex-consultants and bankers), Underpaid lack of clear career progression, 
﻿Wear and tear, Flexible hours and decent pay, Destroys vehicle and some of the clientele can be questionable, 
﻿Tough and Dynamic Environment, , , 
﻿Contracted Software Engineer, Easy to jump in and get started with dev work, Very 'clickish' environment. Not very inclusive., 
﻿Uber Eats is a Rip Off, Instant Money...work when you want.., Wasted gas..long trips for only a few bucks..no one tips.., Start paying what you say you will..no way a person should drive more than ten minutes across town for a meal and another fifteen to deliver it for only five bucks...
﻿UberSTAR Intern, , , 
﻿it sucks now no more surge, drivers pay is getting worst pakk uber!!!😡😡, no goood at all for drivers, fix ur self
﻿Uber disappointment, Work when you want provided there is a demand in your area at any given time., Not a stable full or part time side job. Entirely dependent upon customer demand and you being in the area. I see a lot of uber drivers circling around my area like sharks in a feeding frenzy. No chance of consistency or sustainability., How about assigning rides that are frequent in an area to drivers willing to commit to an assigned schedule.
﻿superb, , , 
﻿Pm, Turnover stress changes tough stressful, Work p, 
﻿It's been ok to work at Uber, Exposure to very intelligent and purpose-driven people Big challenges interesting responsibilities, Very bureaucratic Not necessarily meritocratic Very political environment No bigger bold bets, 
﻿No boss, No boss no schedule perfect for part timers, No fixed income. If its busy you earn great if not then 0, 
﻿Okay, , , 
﻿Driver, The issue is the right places and the right times are generally when people don't want to work. If you are Ok driving from 10:00pm-2:00am then you are going to do well but if you only want to drive 9am-5pm you might struggle, None. They were good to me., 
﻿The market for Uber has gone down resulting in less rides despite the large amount of drivers on the road, Opportunity to make $100+ in 5 hours on weekends if it’s busy, It is never busy on any day., Allowing an option to see busy areas or restaurants on the app would benefit drivers greatly.

﻿COE, Great people funny location., traffic and homeless area needs more security the city need to clean up, Hire professional people we deal with allot personal issues
﻿Absolutely terrible support/infra, Work on your own time (assuming there are customers), It took me a month to get started. I'm glad I didn't count on Uber for my bills or I'd really be in trouble. Awful driver support absolutely terrible infrastructure for the background checks and document approval., Reformat your entire infrastructure so that drivers can actually start driving with Uber within a reasonable amount of time!
﻿Terrible culture, , , 
﻿Used to be great but not now., Fun job for the most part while driving a fare but not enough fares for the time spent waiting., Low pay and have to cover your own expenses. Company seems to always find ways to diminish pay rate., increase income for drivers.
﻿Great work environment, Amazing work mates. Casual atmosphere. Free lunch!, Very limited career growth and very basic salary, 
﻿Great company great people, I am still relatively new but thus far working at Uber has been awesome! It is so nice to be a part of a company that is doing big things and making an impact on the world around us. There is a total learning culture here which is really nice (especially being new). Everyone encourages questions learning and growth. The work life balance is also great!, It can be easy to get lost as a small fish in the big pond which makes it important to speak up for yourself ask questions and be teachable., 
﻿Good Part time job for students, Easy flexible and good pay for doing deliveries, a lot of driving food smell in car, 
﻿Working in Uber, , , 
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Terrible Management, Great Colleagues Decent benefits other than the below market salary Unlimited vacation, Management has their favorites so much so that favortism allows for harassment in the workplace HR is gutting compensation right now. Culture is infested with arrogant hypocritical bootlickers, Quit and allow for real managers to lead these teams you are too self serving.
﻿Dream place for work, You will be heard all the time you can keep your working style great place to work, Not any issue seen so far, Great work keep it up
﻿Horrible, Flexible schedule would be the only thing because at the end of the day it’s minimum wage after taxes gas car maintenance and car wash, Uber eats is the worst! They only pay the distance from restaurants to location of delivery. Roads were closed so I had to go around 8 miles around military base and when I called so they could re adjust my miles they said sorry we can’t. I drove 50 minutes and got paid 4 sad dollars., Don’t take advantage of poor people
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule fair compensation ability to interact with new customers, Driving in south Florida congested traffic,

﻿Driver review, , , 
﻿Worst Experience ---- Ruined my career, There are none... Wait a minute  they will feed you in the afternoon..., Can't able to waste my time in listing the cons..They are unlimited..., Uffff!!!! They can't listen ...
﻿Uber doesn’t care about their drivers, Flexibility is convenient and nice., Wages are constantly cut. Uber takes 25-70% commissions with no disclosure. Drivers are not making anywhere close to minimum wage after expenses and uber doesn’t care. There’s no control over where you end up at any hour of the day; which takes away from the flexibility of the job. This job is physically hard on your body and mental health. Twenty-four hour support is a joke. They always respond but they never read drivers..., 
﻿Uber, Good culture and lot of scope to improve., It will be too early to comment., Need to focus on specific business objectives. Decisions to flow from top to bottom flow (with input from bottom to top)
﻿Business Analyst, Great career opportunities. Very challenging and filled with responsability., Stressful environment at times., 
﻿Great way to earn extra money, Set own hours work for yourself interesting, No set pay no control over who you pick up, 
﻿Uber is an Excellent Company and Employer, Great benefits good pay excellent leadership clear direction great office environment with parking provided at no cost., I do not have any Cons about Uber, Continue to lead by the example of "living our values"
﻿Uber / Uber eats, You can work when you want., Can't change the ride or add a stop once the ride has started and it screws the driver because the rider wants to stop and do an errand., Change the app to allow riders to add a stop stop pick up another rider or change the destination.
﻿Good Experience, * The Hong Kong market is very interesting lots of opportunities to innovate. * Management is not very micro managing * Lunch is provided, * Not many opportunities for those who are interested in technical applications, 
﻿They need Better costumer services, Instant cash out and flexible schedule., It’s an annoying job sometimes, Get better at being there for your drivers
﻿Great Part Time Job, Flexible Easy Good money if you time it right, Trying to make money when there are way more drivers than riders., Drive on busy nights when there is so much demand that the surge will go up regardless of how many drivers there are.
﻿Great place to work at, Treats interns equally as full-times., Can't complain about anything even though an intern., 
﻿West of time, Working for last two months full time once make $70 to $80 some how dont get business for two to three hours. At the end of the day in 12 hours shift take total $100 to 120- 25 dollars gas oil time.... i left its not worth and customer service for driver from company is nightmare if any thing happened and call them their call center agent from India Philippinesany where in world dont know whats going on here in..., Not recommending its better to work on minimum wage at least you dont have to garbage your vehicle, Improve system and cutomer service for drivers so they dont west time money and hard work. We are westing our future
﻿Uber is a scam, Flexibility be your own boss, Bad company.. bad support no benefits, 
﻿Rapidly growing startup, , , 
﻿Driver, Same day pay and hot spots., You have to drive a lot., 
﻿UberEats Onboarding, Chaotic very "young" office. Training poor. You are thrown into meetings all day where they show you the job functions on large screens which you can barely see. Then you are expected to go back to your laptop and do it. They really should consider more of a smaller classroom setting with a nesting/training period before throwing you in. I was also given a work "buddy". She was impatient and snippy...definitely shouldn't..., Train better. You really should consider a classroom setting for the first week or two instead of meeting after meeting after meeting and then expect everyone to know how to use all the confusing systems., 
﻿data scientist, Working environment is not bad, Interpersonal relationship is so perplex and the package is not appealing, 
﻿Dont Get Your Hopes Up, Work whenever you want. Instant cash on hand., They advertise $20hr but that is NOT true!! There are over 2000 registered drivers on the Ms. Gulf Coast and its slim pickin's. I mean you can make $100 a day but "a day" consists of 12-15hrs. Your average is more along the lines of $5/hr. There are more drivers added every single day and Uber only cares that they get their cut. They aren't planning on putting a cap on the # of drivers anytime soon. Most drivers drop..., 
﻿Just not enough depending on the city, can be no money most of the time, stop taking a cut of the wait time money your not the ones waiting on the passenger to come out we are,

﻿Work Place, The company provided us with a lot of opportunities to learn new processes and improve the competencies., There is no broader exposure to the improvements across., 
﻿Uber Customer Service, Benefits (cateringevents dinners) Work atmosphere, Lack of standards and process, 
﻿Uber driver, Create your own shift time. No money interaction between you and customers exerts for tips., not stable income almost no tips,

My leadership trusts and values my opinion. The culture is rich and diverse in many ways. I work with a group of intelligent professional and I love my job., None so far continue to bring in a variety of professionals., 
﻿Decent Money Best Schedule, , , 
﻿So far okay, - benefits are ok but before were better. - nice offices, - not enough pay - favoritism everywhere - not possible to grow without being someones "favorite" - schedule sucks, 
﻿Awesome, Meet awesome people and own work schedule, Mileage on your car, 
﻿Great, , , 
﻿Development Vehicle Operator, Excellent pay benefits and perks. Lunches were catered and there was plenty of sick time and PTO., Unfortunate events led to the layoff of hundreds of hard working people passionate about developing autonomous vehicle technology., Hire back as many of your former operators as possible when testing operations resume.
﻿No Support/Tech Support for drivers, You can work hours that are convenient for you. Most riders are friendly and kind., When you call the toll-free number you will be on hold a long time (if you can afford to lose money while you wait). Representatives/Agents are not trained properly. I had an issue with a document and they kept asking me to reload it instead of telling what needed to be corrected. The agents are from another country so it is hard to understand what they are saying. The company will have you drive 18 mins...., Take note of these Pros and Cons then correct any issues. You may not please investors after your IPO because you have been informed of these problems.
﻿Good for somewhat doing own business, Its good having somewhat your own business, You have to deal with Dealing with the public, The App needs improvement
﻿Save your sanity and money, People are great and most of the time it was great, The company during my employment basically had a customer first employee last policy with little to no regard to the person being the provider. The upper management was non existent as to being helpful really it was like being a slave the difference was little pay. If you really get into it they say your making $20hr or more yet if your break it down; depreciation in your car repairs and up keep- taxes most days..., Try caring about your people.

﻿The best part is you are your own boss, You can choose your own hours so it's really flexible. You are your own boss so you can work the way you choose. The earning potential is good., The earning potential is good but not stable. Sometimes you gain more but sometimes you face a bad day., 
﻿Driver, Drive when and where you wish. Driver support has improved. Mile and minute Driver pay is better now than before. Most passengers are friendly and respectful., Too much wear and tear on personal vehicle. Some trips are just too short to make any profit., Charge the passengers about 10% - $15% more and pass it on to the Drivers.
﻿Good place to work, Good company culture. You'll make good contacts and get a chance to interact with management often., Nothing i can think of., 
﻿A pace for sprinters a place for winners a rewarding job!, The best thing about working at Uber is the amount of ownership you're given and the opportunity to shape your own career. I've been in for 3 months and never had a "doll day"!, At times it can be an environment with high pressure and strict deadlines. being it a global company you will at times have to do across the world calls at unpleasant times, 
﻿Cool very developer-centric company, - Surprisingly smooth hiring process very responsive HRs and ability to talk about tasks talk with future colleges etc. - Very high quality bar for code and architecture - Down-up management style - Very developer-oriented: plenty of things for ease of development instead of formal rules., - Relatively long process of onboard due to size of the company and amount of systems., Make transparent "onboarding-track". It may greatly speedup process at the beginning.
﻿Interesting work good comps growth opportunities, - Lots of interesting projects to work on: The company is constantly expanding into new areas which means no shortage of new projects - Opportunities for growth: Joined as a front-end engineer a few months in already getting opportunities to learn and work with full-stack - Comp is very competitive with potential IPO next year - Team specific: My manager and team are very supportive and advocate strongly for a good..., - Organization: With fast growth it's easy for things to become disorganized - outdated docs multiple redundant resources etc., 
﻿Account Manager - Uber Eats, - Fast paced and high growth and excitement - Modern state of the art technology being used to forge a market - Lunch pantry and coffee provided free each day - Amazing available resources - Casual clothes - Very smart people and operations creating a growing culture, - Casual role - Progression is difficult - Lack of integration between FTE's and casuals, 
﻿Interesting place to work, No micromanagement everyone is welcoming superiors want you to succeed great benefits and room for growth., In the beginning you can not miss any days of training other wise your attendance recorder takes a big hit. Not a lot of free Uber swag., 
﻿Software Engineer I, Exciting project and nice co-workers., Food could be better., Care more about their employees.
﻿It not worth it, , , 
﻿Software engineer, , , 
﻿Best First Job Ever, - Everyone is really really smart and hustles hard - Plenty of things to learn regardless of your position ranking - People like to share and take ownership of their work - Merit and great ideas trump over hierarchy - People really care about their work and are willing to help each other out - People work fast and get things done well - Great place to see innovation everyday - Get to meet people from all over..., - Salary is not super high (Uber pays well in terms of benefits) - Sometimes cliquey, 
﻿No money, Own hours own time own boss, Everything about the job is a con, Look out for your drivers
﻿Had a nice experience, , , 
﻿Decent place if you need some quick money, , , 
﻿Excellent compnay, Uber is innovative growing and ahead of their time., Can't think of any cons as of now., 
﻿Terrible app, Work your own hours Good exercise, I am constantly having issues with the app and I get blamed for dropped orders. The driver support is practically non-existent and the drop off instructions are terrible. I could go on and on but I think I got the major points across., Add more driver support fix the app issues
﻿Community Support Representative, Good for your CV and some people are nice., Terrible salary and alot of unprofessional agressive people. It felt like working at a teleperformance at it's worse. Gossip everywhere. It was a very bad experience. Lack of information and processes. Career development based on how good you are to make managers feel they are your friends is not about being professional and delivering a good result. Discrimination and racism. If you see something not..., Hire older and more experienced people for management. And be more informed about everything. Everything felt improvised.
﻿Very Flexible, All you have to do is turn on the app any time you want and start working. The job is far from mundane. You meet so many different people and every night is different., Sometimes ratings are unfair for example I have been rated 4 stars because a rider did not like my air freshener smell. It was not strong by any means and I was complimented all night on how nice my car smelled. Another time I was rated one star because the riders wanted me to block traffic at an intersection instead of pulling off into a pick up drop off location that was literally a few feet away. Most of my ratings..., Rider should have to provide feedback if they rate below a 5 since we can be deactivated if rated below a 4.7. In most other rating systems a 4 star rating is good!!
﻿WOW this sucks, You make your own schedule, VERY low pay high liability stressful no respect, Pay drivers more
﻿Uber, Pay is good and bonuses are generous, Uber has inconsistent upper management, 
﻿Manager, Good company . Happy to work, Time is good . It's flelible, Good company tension free good salary
﻿Driver Operations ( Customer Resprentative), Great working environment and get appreciation and reward for the same., No salary and learning growth., 
﻿Its okay for the extra money, Its decent money especially in LA during rush hour traffic. Customers are mostly nice and I love the ones that just listen to the music and relax., You dont get reimbursed gas car expenses or anything. I've had to pay over $1000 in car repairs from doing this for a year and a half. The wear and tear on your car is crazy. I'd advise you to get a rental and really only do it if you need some extra cash as a full time job it burns you out., 
﻿Driver, Easy to use app great way to earn extra cash, be aware of your surroundings, 
﻿Uber Delivery Driver, Flexible schedule. Earn whenever you have free time., Difficulty with parking for delivery pick ups, Management is engaged and constantly improving app.
﻿Decent pay, You can work at your own schedule, You won't make enough money if you don't drive within the promotional times., 
﻿Got approved half a dozen times then rejected, Make your own hours and pay is so so, The background check sucks and customer service isn't the greatest, I was disqualified for something not pertaining to the job at task. I cleared the background many times then I fail. I represented your company well and got tossed out to the muk.
﻿LISTEN TO THE 1 STARS, Drive when you want . That is it.., Horrible pay don't make more than $8 an hour after destiny your car has tires insurance.. People are extremely cheap and do not tip.. CONSTANT APP ISSUES.. HORRIBLE SUPPORT.. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT DRIVERS IF THEY SAY SO THEY ARE LYING, Pay 1.10 per mile not. 91c and increase per minute to. 20c not 11c.. Stop kissing customer butt at driver expense...
﻿One of the best places to work, - The environment is very inclusive - Everyone is always ready to help, - Work life balance may be a little weird, 
﻿Never learned so much, Personal and professional development; Working with amazing people; Flexibility, Not much HR structure and support; Senior leadership might be too young in some verticals, 
﻿Great company with diverse culture, Diverse culture with 70% of employees coming from other countries, The local market is a big small, 
﻿app doesn't work, great way to waste a few hours and not get paid, you won't get paid and you'll waste several hours of your time, fire your development team and replace your entire support team
﻿Do not lease a car, You will be your own boss, Compensation is Extremely low pay, Pay more
﻿Unstructured and Baised Company, 1)Young minds at work. 2)No defined work culture. 3)Leaves is not an issue., 1)Highly biased and prone to favoritism. 2)Top level management wants people sitting in remote offices to work like minions. 3)No structured HR policy or dedicated HR. 4)Backend teams does not care work properly and do mistakes often which is then held against other employees. 5)High levels of micro-management. 6)No work-life balance. 7)Does not inform people about the contract basis work while interviewing., Please understand your employees are people too and human errors are still possible by them. Cut them some slack since everyday offers are being changed in cities and it leads to confusion among all teams. Also the level of micro-management is too much which is honestly a stress factor.

I work when I want to and up to 12 hr a day and I have access to my earnings immediately., Sometimes the there are GPS issues. Out of the way driving directions., Can we adjust our earnings when gas prices goes up.
﻿Excellent benefits kind people with great management, The benefits are excellent pay is great - compared to other employers, I can't think of any so far I have only been with Uber for a year, Keep doing what you are doing please take care of your good employees.
﻿Very flexible in determining your output with hustle work ethics., Scramble through the traffic and relying on most busiest events which can cause more chaos in certain times., My resume is not geared towards transportation and service but I have gained lots of insights of myself and people in general of 10000 plus rides. I need to face more of my fears in this world., 
﻿Customer service, Low pay not much room for growth, Pag higher for people who assert themselves, 
﻿It Pays the Bills, , , 
﻿From a Par-Time, Allows flexibility for students that has chaotic and varying schedules semester to semester., The freedom of not having a boss can make you very lazy. Requires a lot of self motivation to do consistently., Make it easier for drivers to contact you. Although online applications are good phone assistance might really be valuable. Add more benefits for drivers. For the percentage Uber takes off all rides it provides little to no benefits.
﻿Very Good, Nice hospitality good work environment, Too many employees sometimes very disorganized, 
﻿Its great with uber, Home when i want to be make money when i want, Customer service don't understand anything, Get some people that speak english for customer service
﻿Fantastic company, Pay is really good treats you like family, Negative public image but is okay, Not much your doing great!

﻿Driver, Used to be good but too many drivers., Long hours little to none profit. Ruins your car no insurance for it. Some customers do not appreciate your service. For $4 ride they want $250 limo service., Need to review the driver rates. Gas+milage+maintenance = 0 profit. You get the benefit but do not share the expenses.
﻿Good money if you know what you're doing., Work when you want great pay get to meet interesting people no boss., Wear and tear on vehicle rude drunk people., 
﻿Great place to learn be challenged, - Amazing opportunities to work on difficult problems - World class co workers to learn from. - Great for personal and professional growth - Fantastic benefits and perks, - Doesn’t always feel like a meritocracy - Some teams have limited scope and opportunities - Strong sense of entitlement from some employees, 
﻿Uber Driver, Flexible schedule to make extra supplemental income. Instant Pay to get you paid quick., Most riders are rude the driver support customer service connects you to people in foreign countries and you can't understand them half the time most riders you end up waiting 2-5 minutes for them just to get in your car riders trash your car out dealing with drunk riders. The uber app itself uses weird routes to get to riders locations. I have lots of riders complain about the route the uber app selects. I think..., Get rid of that horrible driver support make the app more accurate with it's GPS. Give drivers more support and treat them better.
﻿Great way to work for yourself, Instant pay and occasional tips are great. Meeting new and interesting people all the time., It can be sometimes dangerous after bar close with many drunks on the road., 
﻿IT IS NOT WORTH IT, There are no Pros left. Travis already ruined the business before he left. And the guy who took over the business worse than him., Uber lowered driver rates again. you gonna have to drive long hours ( 8hrs or more) to be able to make $100 dollars in bay area and you have to deduct the gas+millage+maintenance etc. Plus you have to pay your own taxes. by driving for uber you put yourself your car and driver license in a danger. As a driver you have no rights against the customer. You will pick up so many rude customers esp if you pick up pool..., Stop fooling people with the false advertisements.

﻿Be an owner!, Tons of great stuff. Amazing talented people. Employees have space and support to form the future shape of the company., As a hypergrowth company Uber needs to find a more sustainable model of growth. Unsurprisingly it feels like a silicon valley startup with a lot of ambiguity and extremely fast pace of change, solidify some principles and practices to help people have more clarity.
﻿Executive Assistant -> Hard work but very inspiring!, Inspiring leadership / Great access to resources / Amazing benefits, Sometimes you feel like there are not enough hours in the day to get everything done with such fast paced & quickly changing priorities., Continue to work smarter vs harder >> Trim down the # of meetings so folks can get work done during the day vs late at night.

﻿Transmission just blew out on me after doing this for 2 years, No schedule work as much as you need to no petulant micromanagers trying to downplay your hard work. Get paid whenever you want., Pay doesn't cover car expenses. Really runs down the value of your car. Pay only slowly lessens over time., Give drivers some kind of incentive to keep going rather than just burning out our cars while trimming our pay and telling us we made bad decisions in life. Would be nice to feel some sense of security.

﻿Great workplace loads of opportunities interesting challenges, You'll work on super interesting stuff with very smart people, Getting bigger so becoming harder to navigate, 
﻿Uber is a company with lot of potential, - Great People to work - You do the work that is directly visible towards people lives - Lots of growth and learning opportunities, - The company is always restructuring - When the company restructures it ignores its experienced staff - You are paid less than the market - People operation / HR is quite a week and understaffed - Different offices are controlled by different dominant people and diversity is just thing on paper, - Handle the changes well - Don't ignore and forget the experienced staff that built the company during difficult times - Always keep in mind that you have to give a development and career path to your employees

﻿UberEats Needs To Do Better. Working As A Driver Is Horrible, You pretty much make your own schedule and work when you wanna work., When delivering for UberEats the app navigation is trash it will have you going to the wrong address to dead ends and will give you incorrect directions that will have you driving in circles.

﻿SPOT Team Member, Great culture and did not care about how much time you take off, Poor communication between teams and management,

﻿One of the worst employers you can work for, - Lots of autonomy - Well known brand - Interesting problems to solve - Driven coworkers, - Toe-stepping and backstabbing are embedded into the culture - People are not held accountable for failures and it's very common for others to claim credit for your work - Limited to no training offered - Bonus targets change dramatically with little to no notice (whatever your offer letter says is likely to NOT be honored especially bonus target and equity refresh), - Invest more in training managers and ICs on critical skills - Trim the under-performers on a regular basis - More transparency on promotion criteria system allows for managers' "pets" to be pushed forward and doesn't offer objective performance evaluations - Reduce the number of "priorities" - if everything is a priority then no one knows what to focus on - Localize the product properly so Uber can be a reliable...

﻿Driver, People getting sick occasionally working nights and weekends to make the most money lots of sitting putting mileage on your own car., Make the drivers more of a commitment there is not much incentive to be a driver. Every effort to help the drivers (guaranteed earnings promotions social events etc.) seems more like a publicity stunt considering that they generally don't help the driver because the threshold is too high or the reward too low., 
﻿Part timer review, Literally make your own hours. Mostly a fun gig. Can make decent money., Uber seems to be favoring full time drivers over part time. Incentives for reaching goals are now impossible for part time drivers and in some cases aren't even offered. Uber seems to be focusing primarily on full time drivers. Part time drivers may do better with Lyft., Don't forget to take care of your part timers or you will lose them to your competitor's. I really liked driving for you when I started but now I'm noticing more changes that are hurting and discouraging part time drivers. If you can't or won't help out part timers you should make this known so that people can make better decisions. I am currently disappointed with some new changes and if they don't improve...

Lower per mile costs on XL rides with a 28% commission taken for the company is forcing me to move off of this platform service will suffer wait times will increase and driver motivation will be at an all time low...., Move your rates back up or you will most likely lose everything you have built!

Your sales pitch about making our pay even out with higher pay per minute and decreasing pay per mile is false and you know it. I have calculated my pay under old system vs new system. My pay was cut 10%. I now recommend Drivers sign up with Lyft. Uber is all about going public. If can cut drivers pay the savings go to the bottom line. BTW Uber my driver rating is 4.95.
﻿Ubereats delivery, , , 
﻿Totally exploitive of drivers, desperate people can sign up for this exploitive freelance job in less than 2 days, Uber eats takes every opportunity to exploit its drivers -- it's built into the process. There is no way to make a setting on your ap to limit how many miles you will be asked to travel during a delivery. The ap does not let you see the delivery address when offering a pickup. It only shows after you have clicked that you picked up the food. If the location is way too far away for you to make a profit too late. Uber..., You're exploitive. You built it into your system. You are reinforcing inequality and poverty in the United States.

﻿Avoid at all costs, nonen at all nope not a one, working for less than minimum wage, find a new job this mess wont last
﻿Hectic but fun. Could use a pay increase though., Very flexible - no scheduling issues to work out. Decent pay - certainly profitable if your car gets decent gas mileage and doesn't require repairs all the time. Amazing perks for frequent drivers. Helpful support net when things go wrong., Per order pay isn't as high as DoorDash and Grubhub. Makes up for it partially with far more orders that execute faster and are spaced closer together for the most part than Grubhub but not as much for DoorDash. Proper execution of this job will result in your car gaining a LOT of miles very quickly. A poorly made/maintained car will not survive long in this environment., Either change your per-order delivery formula to something closer to what DoorDash uses or incorporate automatic tipping like Grubhub.

﻿Policy, Fast paced dynamic team. Lots of smart people, Sometimes chaotic. Senior management at times appear to no know what they are doing, Keep seeking to improve and listen to employees. Stop focusing on leaks and instead focus on causes of leaks
﻿Brand Ambassador, It was an interesting time - Uber was just getting established in the area so this was a neat gig during that initial push for signups. Great opportunity to develop public communication skills. Flexible with schedule., Some of the staff spoke and acted condescendingly toward the BAs - sort of an "I'm smart and work for a cool tech startup and you're just going out and signing people up" kind of vibe. It just struck me as unprofessional to behave that sort of way regardless of whether someone is a colleague or doing low-level temporary/contract work.,

﻿Uber Review, , , 
﻿Manager, , , 
﻿Uber driver, Very flexible. You literally work when you want to; it's a matter of being logged into the app or not. If you need more money you just drive more. I think things have improved since they replaced Travis Kalenick as CEO too. Thank goodness!, As a female driver in SF Bay Area CA I probably had a different experience than most (male) drivers. There is SUPPOSED to be a 'code of conduct' for drivers and riders unfortunately there is a certain type of male who this rule doesn't apply to after he's had enough to drink. AND he can complain about you if rebuke him and Uber will not remove 'negative comments' from a driver's profile. I'm sorry Uber but when..., You need to listen to your female drivers and take them seriously. Most female riders are very grateful to get a female driver - they always say that they 'feel safer.' This is why you will lose some of your market share to any company that can cater exclusively to women. While 99.9% of riders are very nice people it only takes one troll to ruin your night. A man who acts this way should LOSE HIS RIGHT TO USE UBER....
﻿Rideshare, Work on my schedule., Customer and driver support is little to non existent, Better customer and contract service
﻿Be Warned, Health benefits are extremely low out of pocket., No mobility. No inner departmental promotions based off of performance. Management is clueless. Lack of communication from departments. Low pay. metric system that doesn't look out for the employee or take outlying factors into consideration. Safety for GLH locations., Learn how to communicate and to go to bat for your employees. Give employees the confidence needed to feel like their voice is heard and DON'T make them feel as if their safety and feelings are less important than those who they are servicing.
﻿Not worth it!, Make own schedule Quick pay Tips Easy job to get, Wear and tear on car Smelly passengers Rude passengers, Raise driver rates
﻿Uber X Driver Review A, , , 
﻿Operations coordinator, Great company. You get a lot of responsibilities and the employees are really nice. It really feels like you are part of the revolution in mobility., Culture can be a bit rough. There can be a lot of competition between colleagues. It does not always feel like you are valued in the company and feels like you could easily be replaced., 
﻿Happy Driver, In Los Angeles I was making $250 plus a day., Some people can be wierd., I think all my needs been met. I just wish background checks were more faster & all investigations can be under first 48.... Lol
﻿Loving the job and the Uber work environment, Highly capable and motivated colleagues direct impact on the business reasonably good work-life balance ownership/responsibilities, Young large corporates don't yet have clear reporting lines. This is positive (more room for initiative more responsibility) but also means it isn't clear who you should approach with questions or concerns, 
﻿Uber is good company for employees, Uber was gave the commission, This is good company and resource for employees, Management should be always workhard
﻿Amazing company to work for., Great Culture Amazing Workspace Flexible Dress code Free Lunch, There are really no Cons i can Think of!,

﻿Sadly NOT MUCH MONEY AT ALL !, Meet people make your own hours., No way to know how far your gonna drive someone after you pick them up !!😑, Increase the fare at least 50 cents a mile to make it worth.
﻿Good company to work for used to be better, Benefits are spectacular and begin day one. Uber credits monthly save a lot of money on transportation and food. Catered lunch every day free snacks drinks coffee cold brew. Ping pong and pool tables video games board games in break room. Management can be very friendly and helpful. Pretty good pay for entry level. Good people. Almost impossible to get fired (could also be a con there's many people here that shouldn't..., They are slowly taking away/limiting all the good perks. Sick time and PTO accrue at a snail pace. The flu spreads like wildfire because nobody has enough sick time (however they did offer free flu shots in the break room made it very easy to get one). You gotta be friends with someone to get a promotion usually in other cases they expect Uber to be your only one true passion to get promoted at all doesn't matter..., The company is becoming more and more corporate and micromanage-y. They are starting to stop caring about their employees as much as they did a year ago. Half of the managers are wonderful and compassionate people that want to see you succeed the other half are power drunk and/or incompetent.
﻿By far the worst job., The directions are really good on the app., I have worked as a LYFT driver a Postmates Delivery Fleet and now I'm trying UberEats. This is BY FAR the worst idea for a job EVER. God forbid you get the honor of picking up 2 deliveries at once but you only get paid for one because the other is "on the way." You're driving like a madman to make money but the app won't tell you how much you're making till you get a break in the calls--so after 5 hours of driving..., Go to church.
﻿Good, Work life bal is missing a big way, Good salaries for the top management, WLB
﻿Driver, You can make your own hours, Pay vs. wear and tear on your car not worth it., Pay more keeping it cheap for the people does nothing for the people driving for you.

﻿Driver, Flexible Schedule Instant Pay at the end of everyday, Not always guaranteed a certain amount everyday, Make it cheaper for drivers to rent vehicles from Hertz
﻿It used to be better, Flexible interesting people easy to use technology can use destination feature to pick up a few bucks when driving somewhere., Compensation has gone down with flat fee surges and Uber taking varying larger percentages of the rider's payment (sometimes even 50%). They can get away with this because so many people are driving now and many of them do not understand the true cost of driving or taxes., Change back to multiplier surging and taking a consistent percentage of the fare.

﻿Uber Job, You can work on your own time, Not knowing the people in your car, 
﻿Driver, You decide schedule and who you drive., Payment system is always late., Drive for lyft
﻿Not the company they write about in the news, After all previous scandals and rumors about the toxic environment I was of course cautious when joining the company. I don't know if it is the new CEO some HR efforts or something else but Uber turned out to be a very friendly and calm (but not relaxed) company. All in all: - Friendly environment. People are not taking things for granted and I feel that new ideas are welcomed. - Diverse team. - Office facilities..., - Office could be quite noisy at times. - Having a lot of users means a lot of responsibility. When things burn - they burn., 
﻿Internship review, - Free lunch - Discount when using Uber services (Uber UberEats) - Monthly Uber credit, - Limited food choice - I didnt fit into my team which is sad : (, 
﻿Driver, flexible schedule and easy job, bad cut rate for drivers, 
﻿Operations & Logistics Manager, Fantastic work culture mission-driven in pioneering the future of mobility, Not very structured open floor plan, Stay focused on thinking globally and living locally
﻿Uber Driver, Set your own hours and getting to meet new people., After paying for gas tolls or anything car related you are left with just enough to get by. You have to work the max of 10 hours possibly daily to see a little more than decent money. Only worth tolerating is if you have no other option jobwise., Stop reducing and slashing prices for rides.
﻿Good College Job for Spending Money, Pick your hours Good pay for work Tips, Lack of Consistent demand and Lots of driving, 
﻿Good experience, I have a better growth in uber it helps me for my better future., It's were good to join in uber this is first job., We need to improve more better service for riders.
﻿Impactful work that is literally building the future, - Challenging and meaningful work that makes a difference in the real physical world - There are no weak links here; everyone that I've worked with at Uber is extremely smart and competent - Room for growth everywhere - Fun environment, None that I could think of, More international opportunities

I know the CEO wanted to know "how long will a driver continue accepting fares when they are not getting paid" but this is dishonest. After this incident I drove for Lyft for 7 weeks not as many fares but payment is prompt and they have never withheld pay. Tonight I returned to driving...

Customers don't put complete addresses like apartment names and numbers. Wear and tear on car. Support not available in a timely fashion. Constant negative feedback for things out of the drivers control like traffic and a busy restaurant., Make directions clear to customers so they understand how uber works. Back up your drivers a bit by explaining that traffic is out if our control when they don't have their order in 5 minutes. DONT punish drivers because they have to cancel due to bad navigation and not being able to get a hold of the customer. Out if 45 deliveries I had to cancel twice because the customer gave a bad address and didn't pick up their...
﻿Not a job by nice hobby, New experience driving skills communication sky, No job security not enough compensation, 
﻿Good money and flexibility for me, Time wasted sitting down alot, Good stuff all keep it up, 
﻿Director, Innovation and autonomy and distribution, Culture and values and ambiguity, Change faster
﻿Driver, Poor resolution methodstalking to an actual person who you can dispute any discrepancies with is impossible pretty much can’t get any issue resolved if one arrives. I lost a fare because some numbscull decided to claim that they never received their order and Uber went with that and automatically deducted my fare no questions asked hows that for employee appreciation, To be such a huge companyimplement better methods of tracking orders deliveredemployees need protection against empty claims as well as an actual number/person to call to resolve these issues, 
﻿The app is terrible but the pay is good, Flexible hours good tips surge pricing, App UI is slow and GPS is almost unusable, Focus on the driver experience more
﻿Uber Driving Experience, Flexible Personable Fun Decent Money Networking blah blah blah blah, Tiring Unknowing range of customers Not active Sometimes lack of trips, 27% Commision is ridiculous.

﻿Great company!, - many bonuses - plenty of possibilities to lear new tools -company really cares about employees, i didnt find any cons,

﻿FACADE, Time for yourself and family Choose your hours and city to drive, Unfair practice ( not driver friendly ) Deductions are close to 40% at times. Not a long term career... with increasing cost fuel / car depreciation, Support - All replies to CC are already formatted. Just copied and pasted. Deductions - Sometimes what you save in promotions entire day is taken in one ride. At times the deductions are close to 40%. Cust.Centric - Customers are never loyal to you. But to an extent your driver partners are. DOnt say believe them completely but at least give fair recognition.
﻿Uber Eats, Work when you want to, -They only believe the customer and will not support their drivers. I picked up a Mcdonald's order and deliver the order and the customer lied saying that they never received it. -Beware of late night deliveries in the city as there no warning of parking away from restaurants that are located in resident-only parking. I followed the app directions and there was parking in front of the restaurant. Only inside for a..., -Update the app so food delivery is confirmed by taking a picture of the orderer with the food. -If there are parking restrictions in the area of the restaurant advise the driver and direct them to park somewhere else if you won't pay for the parking ticket.
﻿Feedback, Flexibility making of your own schedule, Instability unpredictable to guess the volume on the road and surges were sometimes inconsistent., There is an opportunity to attend a tax meeting at the end of the year this meeting should be a part of introductory training. I could have saved myself so much more money in taxes if I knew how to properly calculate and keep track of personal data. I did not feel like I was set up for success.

﻿Driver, Work on my on schedule, The pay seemed to be little., 
﻿Uber is floor, Work when you want that’s good, Nobody cares about you even Uber, Pay more take less
﻿Driver, Good for the change while looking for a respectful job., Dealing with people that thinks they own your car is horrible. Getting unfair score for problems from their system and not because you provided a bad service. Uber will take over 50% off of the rate paid some times even more., 
﻿Slowly moving from slightly above average to hell in a hand basket., The benefits are amazing yet the pay is offensive. Catered meals unlimited snacks and monthly Uber credits are absolutely a money saver. Very relaxed atmosphere however it is slowly moving towards micromanaging more and more., Pay is offensive until you are an L3 role or higher which takes 3+ years to do from an entry level position. Extremely unorganized due to rapid growth. A large portion of management is incompetent and very under qualified., They are very aware of what they are doing. None needed as they never truly listen or care.

﻿UberEats driver, The money is good but not consistent, Sometimes you can make $220 in 10 hours sometimes it’s $120 in 14 hours. Customers rarely tip on ubereats app. Many customers do not care if there is no legal parking in the area. Some customers are fantastic., Have a minimum pay guaranteed like Postmates does pays minimum of $4 per delivery unlike Uber there is no minimum minimum I have done deliveries which paid $2.80 and had to pay the parking meter .50 cents to pick up sometimes $1.00 at drop off which leaves $1.30 left over for that particular trip. Should enforce rule customer meets driver downstroke dominoes and papa johns does and there is never no issues
﻿CSR, Nice pay nice company few advantages., Too much differences made between employees., The company should equally considerate their employees.
﻿Waste of time and abusive on your vehicle, None I can actually think of, Treated as a contractor Driver support is a joke Taxes are not taken out of your pay check You will NEVER earn what they claim you’ll earn in a week,

Also no clear guidance on how to grow within the company- it often feels like you're walking in the dark and not sure whether or you'll be one of the "lucky" ones that gets promoted., Focus on what matters... people. There are a lot of incredibly talented people leaving this company and it's so sad to watch.

﻿Uber is a good choice for me, I like meeting new people and setting my own schedule. I need the flexibility and this works. It's a great supplement to my full-time day job., The app has its issues especially with navigation. Had to use another program to navigate to my pickups. Other than that there are no cons., Improve the app. I gave four stars because of it.
﻿Uber is a great place to grow, - Lots of opportunities for career growth - Awesome co-workers, - Organizationally immature and sometimes disorganized, 
﻿Driver, Make own hours work when you want, Wasting gas driving around waiting for riders, 
﻿Good, Employee benefits cool environment to work and nice team spirit., Slow growth however if you have skills you will definitely be valued, 
﻿Amazing place to work, Great environment encouraging self-enhancement every day responsibility and committment from day one, Staffing is strongly linked to compelling needs and hiring is not completely allocated to regional teams. Sometimes there is the need to cover temporary vacancies with increased workload, 
﻿User Researcher, Amazing place to learn and grow, Not that great work- life balance, 
﻿Driver, You can Make your own hours, Uber actually pays you .75 cents a mile when someone is in your car. The government says actual ware and tear on your car is 0.54 cents a mile Woot! 0.16 cents a mile profit. They also only pay you 0.075 cents for waiting($4/hour) so if you client wants to stop somewhere and do some shopping (something Uber allows) or your stuck in bad traffic guess what you are making $4/hour., You gotta love that only the Uber employee that has something nice to say is the engineer that makes well over 100k/year. Pay your DRIVERS more. Drastically (4-5x) increase your wait charge. Realize you have actual people out there driving for you not slaves

﻿Uber Driver, It’s flexible with instant pay option., Wear and tear on car saturated market, 
﻿Could be better, Pros are meeting new people improving your socail interactions that can benefit you in more solid jobs in the future., The pay is very low they take about 40 percent if they only took 25 percent they would have more drivers.

﻿Great Place to Work!, The company truly celebrates differences! I love working with such a diverse group of people whose ideas are valued regardless of their backgrounds. I feel that the company trusts employees and gives autonomy and this motivates me to do my best. Work-life balance is great people are competent work we do is interesting and meaningful and there are tons of career opportunities within. Perks and benefits are also..., The culture is very open and casual which is not a bad thing. As a matter of fact a lot of people see this as a plus. However this might be a surprise or seen as a lack of professionalism at first for those who join the company from non-tech companies., 
﻿Apps won't accept Delivery swipe, Good part time job. Work when you want, Not all deliveries are paid., Sort out your partner apps. Make a contact number available for partners. Let your 'Analyst' read the feed-back not give canned answers that do not resolve issues.
﻿Former Uber Driver, Work on your schedule within the limits allowed. Get paid the same day., After you factor in the cost of vehicle fuel maintenance expendables (tires brakes etc.) and depreciation of the vehicle itself-- I would guess true income before taxes came out to about $12 per hour which is fine if you don't have lost opportunity costs and don't have better options. In other words this is great for students retiree's etc. but not something I would recommend as a full time job or even a..., 
﻿Wear and Tear on your investment, Payout rates equal minimum wage while you drive the wheels of you investment, Bad for you good for UBER investors, More money for drivers
﻿Driver, Great job for cash on hand daily., I always end up far away for home., See if you can change the app so you dont end up far away from home.
﻿Uber Screws Over Drivers, Set own schedule and Not sure, Low income corporate does not care for drivers little incentive and the rewards have tanked with New CEO, Fire your new CEO... drivers made more previously
﻿Customer Success Manager, Awesome benefits and office space., NY office is in an inconvenient location. Very bureaucratic and political culture. Must stay in same role for 1 year before switching positions regardless of performance. Low pay compared to comparable positions and companies., 
﻿Uber Partner, Great for those looking for flexible scheduling. Excellent customer service/support as every single issue I have ever had has been resolved within 12 hours., Somewhat difficult to find worthwhile rides in San Bernardino County CA. I frequently have to make the trek to deep within LA County to find consistent rides. Similarly Uber promotions are usually only applicable to rides beginning within LA County., 
﻿A beautiful niche., It's your company you make., Better heat map to help set coarse, Thanks for making it happen
﻿Great People, , , 
﻿Uber Eats - BIKE DELIVERY, You can work whenever steady delivery notifications good pay., Dallas Traffic battery life weather., Please consider biking routes and distances.
﻿Worst company I’ve ever dealt with., Set your own schedule. In some areas Uber is the only option., Awful pay. Awful ratings system. Awful management. Awful support. In any area that has the option Lyft is much more widely used., FIX THE RATINGS SYSTEM LIKE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU TO FOR YEARS. You’re not the only game in town. Stop acting like it.
﻿Like a second family, Good colleagues and managers Team work is superb ! I enjoy working to this company . For almost one year i earned a lot of knowledge  i improve my communication skills  professionalism and you will used to work under pressure., No other benefits/ contractual Monday-saturday worked and mandatory report even holidays, Benefits
﻿Good MNC, free food and flexible time, but cannot enter in to on role no appreciation or team outings, can help employees growth and involve huddle or fun at workgive coupons to avail cab or anything like that to employee
﻿Driver, Can be flexible with work hours and you get to rub elbows with lots of people you would never run into otherwise., Pay is quite variable depending on the time of year and not very good unless its in the middle of the summer and you work in a populated city., Give better incentives to drivers who can consistently provide a good rider experience and who maintain a good driver rating.
﻿Bad all around, Can get paid instantly with instant pay, They don’t send you enough deliveries and when they do it sometimes averages around 2 to 3 dollars a delivery. When you contact them with an issue customer support either doesn’t answer or hangs up the phone and sends a message through the Uber help app. Every time the customer cancels before u make to the restaurant they don’t reimburse you they say o we are sorry. Would not recommend work for different delivery service, Please get better support for issues
﻿Horrible, None at all zero pros I don’t recommend, Lots of wear and tear and not enough money and barely any promotions honestly just work a regular job or deliver food with guaranteed hourly pay,

﻿The worst job, Stressful and makes you run behind the money and forget your own life, Just drive part time like 3 hours a day is fair enough, 
﻿Fascinating, Can't beat the work schedule. You work when you want to but you have to be available when rider request are peaking to get riders., You never know who you are going to pick up and there are a lot of crazy people in society these days. Also though there are plenty of good people. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference., Keep doing what you are doing and listen to drivers as well as riders. They are both bread and butter of the business.
﻿Leasing Specialist, The company really cares about their employers and make sure they have all tools available to succeed., The life/work balance might be challenging, Keep doing a great job

I average over $20/hour but have gone over an hour without a ride -- in San Francisco! *You have to be disciplined and a self-starter to make it as a driver *Lack of transparency from corporate offices. * You will meet lots of interesting (in the disturbing sense) people, Be more open to drivers and listen to our needs and wants.

﻿Excellent opportunity., Great team environment help always available the work is very interesting. Benefits are amazing and the different bonuses are easily obtained. Work life balance is one of the best I've seen with flexible shifts and predictable rotas. Longer shifts means more days off which is a big plus. Progression is always available with hard work and knowledge being rewarded instead of ignored., No cons to report at this time. Love my job., Keep doing what you're doing. It's been a pleasure so far.

﻿Great job to start with, No boss easy money what more can you ask for?, Really need to learn the best times and it sometimes can be a gamble but they are in the process of fixing that., 
﻿Thieves, There are no pros with these guys. Stay away, They will underpay you constantly and then respond with pre written responses when you ask for a fare review. They will deactivate you based on false claims by riders even when they know and admit it is a false claim., Resign
﻿Why Does Uber Need My Credit Card Number?, You can work for 4 hours on a Saturday night and average less than $6 an hour!, They required a credit card number from me. Within two weeks after signing up someone used the same credit card number to obtain an Uber car 3 TIMES on the SAME DAY in a city in Pennsylvania I've never heard of! I live in south Florida and don't travel anymore. Coincidence? Hmmmmm..... I've never had my credit information hijacked and seldom buy anything with this card., Re-examine the necessity of possessing your driver's credit card info and if you must have it keep tighter security on it.

﻿Uber Eats Driver, Great App No wait at Restaurants. Easy drop offs, Low delivery pay ($4-5) per order or $10/hr, Need higher pay. Tips should be mandatory for customers.

﻿Ehhhhh, I'm making 80.00 to 50.00 a day, Not sure how anyone makes 250.00 a day with Ubereats. Other problem is the ratings. I've been really nice and help people with bags when I go to the airport. But have low ratings because of friendliness. Most people are on there during the trip, 
﻿Delivery driver, Know the area Experience in delivery driving, Drive a lot to far off, 
﻿Great place to make an impact, * Tremendous growth company with startup feel * Place where you can make a serious impact * Truly open to working remotely * Great people (smart down to earth passionate), * Hard to come up with one * If you don't live in the city some might say the commute (but they give you great flexibility on working remotely so not true con) * Some may say the food, 
﻿The Uber Recruiter is extremly terrible, The recruiter appears nice., The HR just asked the most basic questions such as education background and some simple questions such as linux comand lines and rejected the candidate with strong background., Be careful with your disgusting recruiters
﻿Senior Software Engineer, 1. The mission of the company is very clear, 1. Some executives joined & left really quickly for various reasons which the company in general did not communicate well to employees, More transparency
﻿Regional Operations Manager, The company is very oriented in your professional development and inclusive of people with different types of backgrounds. This creates a unique environment in which everyone likes to collaborate. Also the process of putting you on board is very well structured with little to no issues. Finally compared to other companies and industries Uber offers a very well nurtured package of benefits + above average wage., The hiring process can be long and exhausting. Also the company is known for having a very fast speed to deliver results which can be overwhelming in the beginning., Keep in mind that because of a long and exhaustive hiring process the candidates are probably the right ones if you hire them. Provide them with support and feedback in the beginning (remember not everyone has the same learning speed) since that's all some people need. If the new hire doesn't need it he/she will tell you.
﻿Current Driver, Good Flexibility but the percentage needs to be adjusted.., Drivers get less than 60% of the fare .they don't pay what they promise.., 
﻿Caution Never move states., Easy schedule work when you want to make extra cash., You can NEVER move states if you want to drive for them., If you relocate to a new state they will longer allow you to drive for them since you have to give up your past state license to get your current states. This show's up as a surrender on your record and they will not allow you to drive anymore.
﻿Senior Software Engineer, - compensation stocks and benefits - professional environment and skilled people - supportive HR and administrative office, almost no cons except Uber is at the edge of industry and paid more attention by media and society and being involved in fake or real issues. But the same issues happen in other companies and only that no one cares about shadow companies they are not revealed. So as result Uber applied some policies more officially about any abuse or issue at work so you may feel concerned about it., 
﻿Disappointed, I can work when I want and don't have to answer to a boss., To much lag time between trips....don't know if there is to many drivers or not enough orders. Maybe both. App doesn't work sometimes so there is missed calls., Away to alert drivers if there is not enough business for the amount of drivers. Picking up 2 orders at same restaurant should be paid 2 pickup fees....each customer is paying the same $5 fee.
﻿Avoid, , , 
﻿Great Engineering Culture, * Great mission: we help empower millions of people to earn extra income and to reliably get to where they need to be. * Strong engineering culture: lots of autonomy solid engineering processes supportive co-workers tight feedback loops lots of innovation and re-invention. Check out the engineering blog to get a better idea. * Lots of energy: it's great to work with people who are energetic driven overcome obstacles..., * Constant apologizing both internally and externally gets tiring and demoralizing * Company is not treated fairly by media lots of exhaggerated bad publicity, Company strategy should be driven by the first principles and market feedback not by the media cycle.
﻿Community support representative, Great bunch of people to work with Excellent training Promote a healthy work life balance Team leads empower you to grow and develop Free food Great salary, I honestly don't have any, Please continue the great work
﻿Moving in the right direction, taking steps to do the right things no haggling salaries / equal pay based on (title years experience education) - not gender previous pay etc. interesting problems to solve learning environment with many infrastructure technologies from in-house and open source well meaning and smart co-workers Celebrate diversity of backgrounds and individuality LGBTQ+ CEO setting by example positive culture, negative press / in the spot light retention of tenured employees looking for the next hot startup Treating contractors as second class citizens, Keep doing what your doing communication and being open is key. Increase gender and minority diversity in engineering Work towards inclusion not exclusion remove barriers between FTE and contractors everyone is part of the success.
﻿on-boarding specialist, Having great co-workers is a plus!, no room for growth and management is poor, 
﻿Great company!!, Best company when it comes to management., none that I can think of., You guys rock! I never had this before and you really look up into your employees. The benefits are great. Free foods are even greater. Work life balance.
﻿Exciting and Empowering, I have truly loved my experience thus far working at Uber. I was hesitant to join because of the news so through my interview process I was very honest asked lots of questions and had a 2 hour conversation with my hiring manager before accepting my offer. Since joining I've been overwhelmed in a good way by the collaboration the valuing of my opinions and the excitement of the work I get to do each day., The best analogy here is like a 14 year old that looks like a 20 year old... Uber is still a young company and I think I expected more things to be in place that are just not yet. Now that I am here and doing the work I see it differently but I think that we're still young we're growing fast and we need to provide the feedback while also being patient to thoughtfully get the right systems and procedures in place., 
﻿Unfair survival tool., Time flexibility. Good for meeting people., Income is VERY low per trip you will have to drive for too many hours to make ends meet. I don´t recommend it as a part time job either. Its a fun gig for a while until your kidneys feel the pain. It is extremely dangerous (physically & financially) considering the time you spend driving your own car against the 0 benefits you get in return. Their bonus incentives are just a psychological game to enslave..., Management members should have at least a minimum of a 4 month driver experience and survive with that income.
﻿Great for Part Time Full Time is a bit tricky, As many Drivers agree this is a very lucrative job and makes great use of technology to bring affordable transportation to every person. Flexible working instant payments and a high social interaction whereby giving access to networking possibilities otherwise unavailable to the average individual on a daily basis., Vehicle maintaining can be super difficult if driving Full-Time and its up to the individual to figure out there taxes every year., 
﻿Uber driver, You can work whenever you want., Gas consumption traffic far distance wait time., Increase salary
﻿Not worth it. No one tips., Make about 5 dollars an hour after gas and wear and tear. Way under minimum wage., Wear and tear. No tips. Low wage in Orlando Florida. Long waits with no tips., Charge higher delivery rates to compensate for lack of tips.
﻿Operations and Logistics Manager, Huge exposure fast learning curve nice culture, Below average pay compared to industry, 
﻿Really Great, the work is very exciting have made really great friends of coworkers, its sometimes hard to get things done at a company of this size, 
﻿Good work, Good working condition provided by the company, No such cons seen till yet, None
﻿Great place, , , 
﻿Work hard learn a lot, Incredible people interesting problems large responsibilities., Pay is rigid and feel under market value., 
﻿Good, Decent job decent pay little to no former experience required Dictate own hours, At night party goers are more prevalent and they can be difficult to work with, 
﻿Great side job Would not recommend to feed your family full time with this opportunity, Flexibility in earning money when you want to, Requests come few and far between because there are so many drivers, Uber Eats - Get more accounts more businesses means more opportunities for delivery.
﻿good if you dont have job, can start working at any time and start earning from the day one, Very low income and long working hours and that cost health, increase the income for drivers and give benefits to motivate drivers
﻿Oportunidade de Crescimento e Valores Incríveis, - Lots of motivated employees who are genuinely good people and care about drivers and riders - Meritocratic culture where top performers continue to get more responsibility, - Clarity of mission has sometimes been lost because of intense focus on competition - Increasing bureaucracy making it hard to move as quickly as previously, Remember the altruism of the mission at hand; don't create so much bureaucracy that it stifles innovation; keep hiring smart genuinely good people
﻿Driver, Conversations with people of all backgrounds and ethnicities., Long hours to make the money you want, 
﻿Uber bad experience, I get to select the timings I want to work., Uber reduced the fares in Mumbai when everything around here is getting expensive. The app is pathetic as you can't select the home destination whenever you want to go home. Most auto rickshaw fares are higher than under fares. They have the most pathetic customer services for driver-partners. You need to keep calculating the fares at the end of day as their system makes errors and you would end up being paid less., Please increase the fares to a decent level. Please have a look at the OLA app as it's a hundred times better than Under for both drivers and partners.

﻿Manager, Flexibility Great environment Great place to learn, Staff working in silos Management pursuing too many at the same time Leadership vs Management (more magement than leadership), Focused on leadership develop people through coaching not results. Staff are too focused on result not people oriented

﻿Lovely company, , , 
﻿Awesome!, I have been working here for 3 months and so far it has been really great! -Management is very approachable and friendly -They are very considerate when it comes to emergencies personal or family related -Work is manageable not that difficult but requires attention to detail -Work space is neutral. enough to have you focused on work and not so to have you interact with other people as well -Free lunch and..., -the training is rather very difficult or atleast for me. I had extended training and was stressed out the entire week. -for the first few weeks it was very hard for me to understand the process -the work is not hard it just needs a lot of attention to detail, Awesome job! Keep it up!
﻿Good. Flexible, Conducive to a schedule in which you prioritize other things for growth., Down-time between fares etc etc, 
﻿Becoming very bureaucratic, Incredible colleagues some very smart ones. Working towards something really dynamic and game changing. Mission driven environment. Extremely fast paced culture, The ship has turned. The strength of Uber was in its decentralized nature of operating. Empowering teams On the ground to make a difference and adapt to fast changing markets locally without waiting for someone in HQ to make a call. Now especially in marketing. It’s full of folks trying to stroke their ego by centralizing the stupidest of things. I mean literally there are teams who do busy work of making decks that..., Cut the fat. Stop the march to centralization.
﻿Good part-time gig, It was a good option for the flexibility aspect of it., Too many drivers in the area due to the large territory in Delaware, Make Delaware into two territories..north and south

﻿Uber Eats Delivery Driver, it can pay weekly or instantly, DOES NOT PAY ENOUGH!!!! less than minimum wage before even factoring in gas expenses I drove around in Atlanta for 4.5 hrs and made $28 i spent $17 on gas to that's a net of $11 for 4.5 hrs! Definitely not worth it! Do yourself a favor and work with another delivery service company that requires a good minimum payout per hour! Also they don't give you enough information about where you need to be and what places will..., Pay contract drivers for delivery better. No one can afford to spend 4 hrs driving for $28
﻿Awesome, Free food Awesome work environment Nice management, No cons as far as I remember,

﻿great experience on working here, amazing work culture and eposure to work ethics, i dnt think there are any cons, 
﻿Barely min wage.... your drivers are your business wtf? I tried to give zero stars but it won’t let me., Flex hours. Beats a hot stick in the eye. You never have to meet anyone you work for., Low wage they will simply fail to pay some deliveries and then their out of country support team is incapable of assisting. You NEVER meet anyone your working for. It’s probably easier to abuse us this way. I am just doing this for pocket cash but I see people out there who need the money. This is an abusive company that also makes it hard for customers to ‘in app’ tip. You don’t know where you are going when you hit..., Take care of your drivers and delivery. Make a tip the norm for folks not the exception. Without us you just have a cute app.
﻿I deliver for uber. Its alright., Work your own hours. Freedom Cash out same day, No customers tip because uber doesn't encourage tipping., 
﻿Not a bad part time gig, , , 
﻿Uber Eats, Every day is an adventure with a new set of challenges Cash Tips More orders than postmates and door dash, Uber calls their workers independent contractors so they can circumvent the Federal Labor Standards Act. You have little to no rights. You're responsible for 100% of your fuel and maintenance costs for your vehicle. Hourly pay varies significantly and it is often less than minimum wage. And pay per mile changes often. They want workers who are enticed by “being your own boss and making your own hours” so they can turn..., Stop breaking the law
﻿Fun atmosphere, , , 
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Driver, There is no other economy gig that I have found that will pay as well as Uber granted you live in a big city. If you work full time you would average around 20 dollars an hour after all the expenses and gas. This is a lot of money for a job that lets you work whenever you want. There is a lot to be said about a job with this amount of flexibility especially if you are a student like myself. Great side job but a terrible..., Traffic sucks rush hour can be very stressful and is dangerous. I see at least 2 wrecks every time I work a few hours and I cant help but think its only a matter of time till I get in one. People are rude and some will even treat you like you are their butler. These are the same people who give you a rating and if you don't impress them they will get you fired any rating under 4.6 means deactivation. It is not about..., No management
﻿Greenlight Hub Expert, The best career advancement path possible. This company has a very diverse employee base which is very amazing. Very supportive of all aspects of culture. I am proud to be part of the Uber Brand., I don’t have any., Keep doing what you are doing. It’s working. Creating a very unique environment. Very safe and comfortable.
﻿Delivery Driver, You can work whatever hours you want., Not the best pay and it takes a lot out of your car., I am looking for a full-time Sales position.
﻿Uber driver, Could work when wanted to at first really great pay., Dealing with extremely intoxicated crazy people that always trashed your vehicle. There wasn’t much support from corporate when you had an issue with a passenger., Better focus on help handling unruley passengers
﻿Driver, The ability to drive and get paid for it any time I am available makes the Uber Partner platform an excellent employment choice. Choice is so valuable it turns into a privilege. Driving for a full hour of work amounts to a descent pay given its cons., Managing resources becomes very stressful with the control you have as an Uber Partner. You can't set the amount you'll charge passengers and you'll never know where you'll end up after a fare is complete. Uber remedies this with excellent incentives such as paid long distance pick ups set destination pickups and trip count completion goals but leaves much to be desired. You'll face plenty of competition and as a result..., Increase driver pay. Other than that I don't have advice but suggestions: Limit driver ability to log in based on supply and demand with "slots in a driver array" method that's updated in real time and based on location. Weed out drivers who refuse fares rated poorly and have driven too long. Figure out how to get drivers back home without dead miles like increasing a long distance fare's price.
﻿Exploitative, Make your own schedule ok side gig, Expensives will drag you below minimum wage unless you are in SF or NY, Raise pay designate one support contact for each driver.
﻿Operations Team, , , 
﻿Uber driver review, There is flexibility in your shift times, Driver partners are not treated with respect. We are not payed accordingly in a market where the driving industry thrives. The mimimum wage after expensives is less than what you would make working in a fast food place. Additionally the quest promotions are a joke which goes to show how the "employees" view us drivers., 
﻿Uber is almost great, Flexibilityyou never lateDrive when you want and where you wantmeet some people that can motivate you doing something more in your life, Rate cuts$xmile is aweful right now as 08/27/2018 Dallas-Fort Worth is .60 cents per mileUber doesn't care about you but abour your businessthe one you can bring them., Rise the per mile rate to .87 cents per mile minimum or 17% max cut.We do not ask too muchjust take home more and that's it.You are taking us drivers to dangerous hours to be able to make enough money to pay things and work again to pay the nexts because we do not take home enough to say "Yes I like being a partner with Uber"
﻿Bonuses Vary Per Driver, It helps to pay the bills., I understand ride-share companies want to milk their drivers for every penny per mile that they can but ALL drivers should receive the SAME number of rides to receive BONUSES as every and any other driver! Also I filed this complaint with the Help Desk and it has not been addressed., Regulate incentives universally... no driver should receive a bonus for a less amount of drives than the next driver... why does driver1 get their 1st eligible bonus at 40 drives when driver2 gets their 1st eligible bonus at 75 drives? Please explain how this is fair.
﻿Why I feel like a lucky guy for landing this gig, Longer shifts more days off. If that's what you like. Reliable shift patterns and schedules given weeks if not months in advance. Accommodating with time off especially for emergencies. Progressive relaxed atmosphere that encourages growth and personal development. Casual dress. Can't say enough about this one being comfortable over being in a suit makes it easier to just get on with the day. Social events and..., Longer shifts. Personal preference on this. I'm easy going I don't really see cons to working at Uber., Keep doing what you're doing it's working.
﻿Account Manager, You got uber credits which was nice., Management was not all that great., 
﻿Great team and fun environment, , , 
﻿The best way to get cheated!, Your gas and time will make Uber earn more money! (After all it's benefiting someone! Who cares how much exploited you are!), Everything except when you get a promotional pay or when customer falls asleep and could not receive the food! ;), First  make sure to stop tricking poor people to exploit and make money. Second train your support staff to not harass the drivers who are already being cheated! Third stop sending multiple drivers to pick up the same order and waste one's gas and time for no payment Fourth stop sending drivers to closed restaurants Fifth have some standard procedure for every complaints do not discriminate Sixth.....I'm tired...
﻿Uber is Cool, Uber is a fast growing company with new opportunities all over the world for people of all ages. What's great about that is you get to work with people from all over the worlds and share expertise. No matter your location or age you can get a great working opportunity., Here in Egypt the environment is good but there's a great area of improvement. The company is still growing and we are still in the process of creating a structured operations so it can get messy and hectic for a lot of people who are used to organized operations., To review the hierarchy in Egypt because a lot of employees are doing more than their job description but not fairly compensated.
﻿Awesome 3 months!, *Great work environment. *Freedom to manage your work. *Flexibility *Respect from the leaders. *Transparency, Non so far. Hope there won't be in the future as well., More transparency on IPO
﻿Terrible. Scam. Slow. Evil., Instant Pay. That is it., Uber is by far one of the worst companies on Planet Earth. You do a ride uber takes more than half of the profit. Instant pay is always down. Will wear your car to shreds between oil changes tires av axles ect. Carry so many different people in your car is stressful to the car itself. People never tip. Can't blame them. The amount they are charged is ridiculous. The driver sees pennies of that. The new owner of uber..., Get a heart. Pure evil company. Customers know it too. Raising rates? Not paying drivers better? Oversaturated markets? Unhappy drivers? Then expecting riders to get good stellar customer care. Ridiculous. learn some ethics. And business retention skills. Pathetic. Pathetic. Pathetic.
﻿Worst company ever beware, Convenient hours thats about it., Poor communcation Wear and tear on your car Cust messes never paid by uber Charge to much when your providing everything, Lower rates and add insetives for loyal drivers
﻿Uber eats, I can travel over Toronto., Very dangerous to ride a bicycle and it makes me getting tired., Nothing
﻿I hate it, Great side job to make extra income in your spare time, The money you make for Uber isn’t great. On avg. I get about 12-13/ hr. Which sounds good but after gas maintenance and cost associated with having a car you barely have enough money to eat. Not to mention your cell phone bill. Also they canceled my instant pay which pretty much killed my ability to make money. Can’t drive if you don’t have cash.

﻿Uber Drivers are INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, Flexible schedule weekly pay app is easy to use. As Independent Contractors we can refuse service to anyone. That’s right! Drunk? Smelly? 5-8 passengers trying to fit into your car? CANCEL the ride and refuse service!, Earnings: We are not paid for driving 2 5 20 or even 30 minutes to pick up a passenger. After picking up drivers in Tucson receive 75 cents a mile and 9 cents per minute. The IRS allows us to deduct 55 cents per mile. By the IRS deduction I don’t earn anything after adding up my mileage - how far I drove for a pick up versus how far I drove to drop someone off. It adds up to covering my vehicle expenses only...., 1. Address the issue of pay - Increase the portion you allocate to drivers or REQUIRE passengers to pay gratuity! We endeavor to provide a 5-star service and Uber has cheapened the product and service and is responsible for the poor attitudes towards drivers like we’re servants who do not earn minimum wage.

﻿Great Saturday night job is the best time to make extra money if you have nothing to do...., Flexible schedule and able to work Saturday night. time goes fast and you have back to back rides., Far away trips sometimes you dont get trip coming back......, give more return trips for far away more than 15 miles trips
﻿Not without its faults, Flexibility and ability to make ones own schedule, Dealing with issues regarding account can get frustrating due to the ineptitude of customer service.,

﻿COE SPECIALIST II, Free Food Free transport Good package if your fresher., Lot of work 10 times more than the package they provide., 
﻿Uber, Fare Price surges can be a great thing for drivers however it is only a fair rate considering your travel to the customer., Regular fare compensation are too low. Way too large of a percentage is being taken by Uber. 30% is not justified., Reconsider fuel costs with the fares along with the pet/service animal policy.

﻿Uber ATG Toronto Self-Driving Vehicles Toronto Uber Advanced Technologies Group Toronto, Truly amazing team. The team is of very high caliber with very strong researchers that are truly on the cutting edge of deep learning research and are staying on top and work hard. Super interesting work and amazing data. Strong results delivered over and over again sometimes against strong headwinds against the wider org. Team is collaborative and friendly The org as a whole is moving forward in general..., * Repeated strong success of deep learning models coming out of this group comes with a territory and politics in the org which is really universal across humans/workplaces especially in a competitive area like self-driving. * It is very important to be unaffected/able to stay out of wider politics and continue cranking out work/results if you are at Uber ATG. This can be challenging but overall the results coming..., Raquel is doing a truly amazing job and Uber is really lucky to have her onboard.. In my opinion she is the single most valuable MVP at ATG and anyone should consider themselves super lucky having an opportunity to work with her. This is an obviously very strong personal opinion and could be biased but it's honest.
﻿Uber X Driver and Uber Select, Great Money great working options for times, Not many some times getting caught in traffic in way to pickup,

They take you around and around asking you the same questions over and over again and have no respect for the drivers though they love issuing apologies without solving your issues. They have constant issues with their app and as an UberEats driver your trips REGULARLY go missing and you have to fight tooth and nail...
﻿Rideshare Driver, Flexible schedule and long vacations possible (albeit with no money), Make less than minimum wage and destroy my car in the process, Too many drivers too much wait and only $3 for a short trips = perpetual losses
﻿Great Part-Time Gig for a Limited Time, If you live in or near a city this is a great job for making a little pocket cash. Turn the app on get a handful of drives in and earn a little extra for groceries., The wear and tear on your car plus the cost of gas plus the cost of vehicle maintenance plus insurance plus the taxes you WILL have to pay at the end of the year are egregious. When you actually crunch the numbers on this you will barely be making above minimum wage. With the addition of Uber Pool you get into real trouble. A good portion of riders have figured out that they can order Uber Pool and regardless if..., Uber Pool is a disaster just stop it. Additionally recruiting too many drivers floods the market. When I started I was making $20-25 an hour with ease. By the end of my 2 year stint I was barely making $12. When I'm driving through the Microsoft Amazon T-Mobile campuses and don't get a single ride for 45 minutes it means there is something wrong with the operation of the company not the drivers.
﻿Fun But... The Pay Is A RIPOFF..., *It is fun to drive and meet new people. *Flexible schedule *If you are retired bored lonely don't care about money and want a reason to get up in the morning...this job is for you! *Sometimes you will meet some AMAZING people that you can befriend. *You will have a lot of great stories to tell especially if you drive late at night. *On a good week I'll make 10% tips., *After you subtract your driving expenses this is at best a MINIUM WAGE job and it is VERY easy to make LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. Perhaps drivers who work the late-late shifts do better but not much more. The economics of driving for Uber is just not worth it. Beware drivers who brag they make lots of money because they are not subtracting their expenses and payroll taxes. *Doing your own taxes and paying the pay..., Keep recruiting non-American born drivers because you will keep them fooled longer.

Truly a place where what you do has an impact on your community in a direct way. You're given the space to do things your own way and take risks and help the company move forward., We are still finding our feet in terms of our work Culture. It's not the same what it used to be when it comes to speed of execution (to a large extent in a good way) but still 'agility' is our key strength and we can't let go of it., Continue to have a maniacal focus on setting up a work culture which thrives on doing something memorable (for our employees driver partners rider restaurants etc) . It's not a 'or' game it's an 'and' game. That means while we tell people to be respectable and nice to each other... But it doesn't mean that we start to compromise on the bar of excellence
﻿Driver, The only Pro's to driving is you meet people and you can pick your work hours, POOR pay! UBER is taking 1/2 of all the drivers fair Riders are rude disrespectful of your time when it comes to the wait feature. Price of gas is high wear/tear upkeep: car washes oil changes mileage. It's not worth it!, Pay your drivers better. Stop taking 1/2 of the earnings
﻿Uber eats driver, No pros! It is a joke !, The pay is ridiculous! When you sit down and really do the math your take home is way below minimum wage. Most days you spend 30 minutes to an hour just waiting for one order that will pay $5 if you are lucky., Pay your employees fairly .
﻿Driver, It was a good company with great experiences, low pay and driving in traffics, 
﻿UberEats abuse and dispose, I was doing okay for the first 6-7 weeks by doing around 60 deliveries per week which brings boost and quest bonuses. Extra bonuses basically covers your gas and taxes and rest is yours but 7th week suddenly i get no boost and no quest at all., Without boost and quest you are basically delivering for almost free. Specially after schools opened your distances like 1 block away which you only make like $3.49 for each delivery but during rush hour you have to wait over 20 minutes for food plus you usually do not get any tips either from college kids., UBER doesn't want drivers to have stable income because there are always new drivers and why not to abuse and dispose them? I don't have any advice to management because no point to advice to these kind of greedy corporations who doesn't care about its workers at all.

﻿Driver, Flexible schedule and direct deposit, Very poor communication between drivers and customer service/management, Look at the perspectives of both riders and drivers with issues in order to have better resolutions better communication and become more successful as a company because at the rate it’s going there will be more state and federal regulations coming in to enforce policies that will put restrictions on the company.
﻿delivery driver, flexible time app is intuitive., low pay little order during off peak period, 
﻿Challenging recruiting experience but well worth it, Uber is a huge company so every team in every geo has different dynamics but overall the company is working hard to remain as focused on top priorities and moving forward with its main challenges. The culture is fast-paced but with unique challenges that come with Uber's scale (even if something affects 1% of trips that's a lot of trips and so on). On top of that they aim to keep a structured approach to work-life balance..., Process was a bit lengthy (about 6 weeks) but other that that I'm very satisfied with my experience., 
﻿They take all the drivers' money, You can make your own schedule, The company takes out too many fees.,

﻿Uber Autonomous Technology Developer Operator, The company and the working conditions are top notch, The distance to travel to the office daily., 
﻿A great place to be, After having worked at several Dutch companies over past several years and exploring the market by attending professional gatherings and applying for different jobs in the field I think that Uber is one of the best tech employers in the Netherlands because of the challenges at work career opportunities and compensation (salary and benefits).

﻿Expert, short hours not to many opportunity for 40 hrs, Be more honest to employees, 
﻿Communication, , , 
﻿Terrible company, Flexible schedule and can take breaks whenever you want., In reality your take home pay is $5/6 per hour. Take the amount you made for the day minus the 35% percent taxes that belong to the government then minus the amount of gas you used. Then take the remainder amount and divide it by the amount of hours you've been driving for the day. You're driving for free., You guys are literally ripping people off.
﻿Great place to work!, All the normal tech company perks pretty good work life balance dog friendly office etc etc etc, I honestly don't have anything to complain about so far., Keep working on improving the public image of the company. Big strides have been made over the last year.
﻿customer service, free food drinks and good bennies, high stress and limited time off, dont hire relatives
﻿Driver, The economics do not add up in a way that allows you to make money once gas and wear and tear are factored into money earned, Pay drivers more and listen to insights from those driving. Improve navigation tool within the Uber driver app, 
﻿I loved working for uber, , , 
﻿Driver, Same day pay. Instantly deposited to your debit card., Your trading in the equity value of your car for cash. It's not worth it unless you Desperately need money. (EX: If you had to choose between not eating for the day and doing Uber was your only option then by all means it may be worth it for you) Uber takes a chunk of your earnings with every ride...not sure how it was before but from the looks of past reviews drivers were ba lot more happier with their earning a couple..., Pay the drivers that are actually picking up the passengers/running their cars into the ground well vs taking such a huge cut from each trip.
﻿SE2, decent pay random hiring and level assignments (if lucky), bad culture weak management on all levels random hiring and level assignments (if unlucky), 
﻿Not all it's cracked up to be, , , 
﻿Community Operation Specialist, Great place to work with, Less opportunities to grow with the firm, 
﻿I enjoyed the fun connections and conversations... not so much on the pay, You get to meet people from all over the world and get to know people you'd never meet otherwise. My rating is 4.97 with 997 trips. I loved the flexibility the most...which is why I do it., My experience was overall great... but the pay and wear and tear on my vehicle makes it not viable long term., Adjusting the pay so that it actually covers expenses and a decent salary would be the main issue. Not getting paid to travel to a pick up was not ideal.... I've driven 25 minutes to pick a ride before only to have them take a ride that was 5 minutes long.
﻿A lot of work and expenses for very low pay, Ability to set your own schedule, Use your own car and gas, Pay your employees better for their time and effort
﻿Partners Support Representative, I got a lot of experience during my work at Uber as Partners Support Representative. meet lots of Uber and Uber Driver users with 1 on 1. giving a very valuable experience there I can measure how professional I'm, Overall uber has a good organization but very unfortunate how uber work that adheres to the work of uber abroad can not be accepted by the people of Indonesia., 
﻿Community Support Representative, Great path to move up after a short time, I am new here so nothing yet, 
﻿Dont, Own hours drive your car, Little pay very boring, Give the drivers more money we are not delivery slaves
﻿Why you should work at Uber, * Meaningful and world-changing work * Brilliant colleagues, * Lack of great managers * Lack of stability in ELT, 
﻿They do not care, It's easier than some delivery apps because you don't have to order or pay for the food yourself., Everyone I know who drives for ubereats knows they don't care about us. They tried to get us excited about an app update which turned out to be purely cosmetic. They talked about a new "wage increase" that's actually a wage decrease for people in most cities. They're the only delivery app I know of that gives the driver so little information - you have no idea where you're taking the food until after you've picked it..., 
﻿Uber Driver, Own schedule. Own schedule. Own schedule, Low pay. Low pings. Crazy surge, Raise driver fares
﻿Technical Support, None you will like lyft better, pointless ignorant time wasted stupid, Uneducated in background processes they give drivers the run around never helping with the main issues nor giving you answers.
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Not constant enough in the Atlanta area, Work on your own time earn extra income meet some great and interesting people learn the area more having fun on the job!, Not enough demand in Atlanta lack of incentives for drives to take to the road and accept riders low fares for riders = low pay for drivers gas prices will take a lot of what you earn if demand is not high no benefits other that flexibility of work hours., PLEASE INCENTIVIZE DRIVERS WITH MORE THAN WORK FLEXIBILITY
﻿Extremely Low pay, Your own schedule and that's it., I've driven for ubereats for about 6 months and it's getting worse. Now they launched a new payout that's supposed to pay you equal to minimum wage minus the drive to pick up the order. They're calculating the wait time. So they ping you to pick up food further now so they don't have to pay you a wait time. That means a longer commute to pick up the order and more gas. McDonalds has to be the worse. My last order was..., Take a look at your competitors and learn how to pay people. You guys are starting to be worthless.
﻿Pretty solid job depending on what you re looking for, good benefits casual work atmosphere young and energetic people, I don't have anything bad to say, 
﻿NYC-$39.83 in 10 hours., Cool app easy to use. Make your own hours., Decided to type this since I've been waiting for a pick for an hour and a half. Earnings are minimal in NYC. The promotions get less and less. There is hardly anymore area boosts for uber eats. After gas and taxes it is so not worth it. Might as well find a par time job that pays per hour with no where or year to your car. No real driver benefits. I think they think a cool app is all we need., Have consistent and better promotions.
﻿drvier, plently of business peak time, not make enough money, provide reasonalbe incentive
﻿Uber is Great, Good salary. Second to none benefits., Young people in management need seasoning., Get more skilled and mature mid-level management
﻿Best thing out there when between jobs., Flexible hours and decent pay. Since Uber requires customers to use either a credit card or a debit card tied to an active bank account (as opposed to a pre-paid debit card) you stay clear of the riskiest customers that cannot be traced easily., You put plenty of miles on your vehicle. I'd recommend having a vehicle extended warrantee on it and perhaps an AAA membership to help mitigate., Keep on with your continuous improvement of the driver's experience!
﻿Young and Awesome, - Energetic - Great atmosphere - Fast paced - Talented and smart individuals to learn from, - Lack of possible Advancement opportunities, Keep doing what you are doing
﻿Uber Eats Delivery Driver, Driving for Uber Eats offer scheduling flexibility., Uber Eats is by far one of the worst employer experiences I have had in my entire life. No training or appropriate resources are provided.

Most customers treat you like an automated drone and simply take the food without even friendly greeting or a thank you. They..., Treat your employees with respect. Pay them better. Compensate travel time long waits for food high gas prices allow drivers to see respond and dispute poor ratings. Do not allow negative ratings of new drivers until they learn the ropes especially with the zero preparation and zero training offered. A frequently asked question or minute video is not hands on learning. Value drivers as much as you value money. People...
﻿UBER EATS SUCKS!!!, if you really think about it there are no pros, the drivers which make this company run are treated the worst and uber is constantly trying to find ways to take money from the drivers... customers lie and give bad ratings and there's nothing you can do about it uber gives out batch orders that customers don't know about and use it like you took long when there was an actual delivery before them also uber short changes you on batch deliveries(best to not accept them)..., why don't y'all stop lying and actually go do uber eats for a month straight and see what it's really like for drivers all this we're listening to you fake feedback crap is a lie... what actual driver would suggest the crap that uber says the drivers asked for...NONE!!!
﻿Self Driving Operator, Pretty good pay and benefits/perks learning new tech and tools., - Little to no upward mobility - Frequent Re-Orgs - No transparency from management - Current Leadership has made poor decisions with no accountability., Listen to on the ground employees feedback and current leadership needs to be shuffled out.
﻿The best place to Work!! Uber Technology Platform using app connects driver-partners and riders., Amazing culture value and work-life balance. Folks are extremely talented and collaborative. Diversity environment. The Benefits are next level. The Leadership team are open and interested in your ideas from any level. I'm feel very proud to work here., I just completed 3 months working at Uber and until now nothing to say about downside., 
﻿Uber and lyft, The ability to meet many people from around the world., Wear and tear on vehicle and the competition from fleets., Regulate the fleets I'm a company driver and they're basically a bunch of bullies. There are many opportunities in my state but im being systematically pushed out by fleets.
﻿Okay part time job, , , 
﻿Great Relaxed Work Environment Amazing People, Get to work with so many amazing people and make great friends. The young nature of the company means that there is a huge amount of change happening every day and it's an great feeling to see a project that you worked on get launched in just a few short months and get rolled out to the rest of the world. The receptiveness of new ideas is a huge pro as it allows Uber and Uber Eats to continuously evolve and streamline..., Although having a relaxed office can fantastic sometimes it's a little too much and it feels like more of a social hangout than a proper work environment., Finding the right balance between a relaxed environment and keeping things professional is essential.
﻿Still growing into our feet, Insanely smart people massive problem space growing by the day and plenty of career growth opportunities. Still a fairly horizontal structure but depends on organization. New leadership heading company in the right direction and ushering us into being a company versus a start-up., Uber has long had an identify crisis whether it is a large start-up or medium-sized corporation. With this many of the controls and infrastructure needed for a company of this size don't exist still. Also given the space priorities shift quickly. The hottest problem last half could be totally defunded the next which can be frustrating.,

﻿Ubereats Delivery Driver, The navigation app could use improvement in dense urban areas. The pay rates tend to fluctuate significantly day-to-day/hour-to-hour; sometimes it's not worthwhile to drive., Stop messing with the pay rates so much.,

Definitely their were some issues management but I would recommend to anyone fresh out of college or still attending. Great benefits chill environment. No micromanage. Free lunch and snacks. Always providing new trainings for new products launching. Provide scheduling for all 3 shifts with pay increase, Pay could definitely be increased more positions that pertain to the need of the job itself. Sending out lines of business out the department, Start treating employees like they actually mean something to the company. Their the ones keeping the place going
﻿I have been working at PROS full-time (More than a year), Possibility to learn and grow., No cons just a great company, Give employees a chance to learn new stuff in preference to being left maintaining the same little subset of the business.

﻿Decent but not the greatest, Work when you want meet interesting people learn your city fast., Lots of miles sometimes you make nothing and a lot of waiting even in prime times and areas., Can't really give advice to an app. Not too much support from the staff at Uber do things yourself.

﻿UberEats less profitable, You can do it whenever you'd like you make your own schedule.., No one tips no matter how much customer service you give them. People are greedy and Uber takes too much of the cut., Let the driver make more than $10/hr before wear and tear on your car when doing just deliveries.
﻿Talent acquisition and retention, Amazing people and managers. Managers are approachable and want what is best for you., The way that recruiters evaluate talent and attempt to retain that talent is incredibly poor. The Uber name attracts plenty of talent so they don't seem to care if someone isn't being utilized to their fullest capacity or being placed in a position that truly leverages their skills adequately. Instead you are viewed as just a number to plug in a gap. If it works great if it doesn't then they will just find someone else., Know your people leverage their skills place them in a position to showcase those talents or lose them.
﻿Wonderful tech company to learn grow and create, Cutting edge technology smart people unmet challenge fast growth., Some toe steppers are really annoying., 
﻿Excellent Place to Work, - Like-minded people who challenge each other - Very relaxed and chilled culture - Freedom with accountability, - Lots to do in very short period - Never off office, - Bring in strict work-life balance like no disturbance during weekends - Better visibility on Career Track

﻿Uber Eats, Good to meet people good application but need upgrades, Uber Driver since December 2015 Uber Eats Delivery Driver since October 2017. When a new request for delivery appears you know where to go to pick up the Uber Eats Order but NO IDEA about the final destination sometimes you drive 15 to 20 minutes to pick up and order that will be deliver half a block from the restaurant uber pays you "$2.82 Total" give you (I'm seeing an actual delivery that I did Uber pays start..., Please do something to pay at least MINIMUM Wage to your employees and encourage your customers to TIP the driver we are suffering what Servers are suffering directly in the restaurant!
﻿Great Place to Work (Before the Merger with Grab), Uber 2.0 (under Dhara) is a very different company compared to Uber 1.0 (under Travis). While it's sometimes difficult to distance the new Uber from its past the company has come a long way., In March 2018 Uber sold its southeast Asia business to Grab and exited the market in this part of the world., 
﻿Operations Manager, , , 
﻿What a disaster of organization... Uber certainly do not care for employees, Fancy snacks (absolutely irrelevant) Fancy office (I could live without it) Fancy Mac's, Top management is like spoiled children: they believe they have some kind of superpowers and when something does not work just cry and point fingers blaming their direct reports and throwing them under the bus with absolute fear of losing their powers. No Human Resources department it is inexistent (they call it People & Places and I have no idea what they actually do). No career plan they basically lie..., Please hire GROWN UP'S for top management.
﻿Ubereats, , , 
﻿Operations, Great liberty to create and innovate very demanding job but also ver yrewarding. The team is very open to teach and give advices about matters., High pressure enviroment and not so flexible with deadlines. As an Intern you get requested as much as anyone else in the company but is paid less., Coordinate better the team and undertand better its needs. Also maybe a few more interns on the team could help improve the workload.
﻿Driver, They are ok until someone think you are not good enough and they just invalid your vehicle, Only the customers can tell them whatever and they just go for it They assume that you dont have your phone standing while your driving and keep messaging you in for that even though its not true, I had my side mirror while i was driving for uber and now im not allowed even to drive for deliveries because of it and now no income to pay for the mirror or work at all this is not fair
﻿RUN, Free food and transit reimbursement, How much time do I have?, Advice to upper management: your junior-level managers/supervisors are incompetent.

﻿Greenlight Expert II, , ,

﻿Currently employed it's ok, team is excellent knowledge can be gained, hours and pay aren't exactly top of the line, 
﻿UBER WOMEN DRIVER SAFETY, Great for women drivers during the day., Night time pick ups are not suggested unless pick ups are at the airport. Security concerns when men sit in the front seat. Uber should advise men traveling alone to sit in back unless woman driver invites passenger in front seat. Just unsafe for women drivers at night with no button to press in case your in situation., Have an app for women that serves women who don't feel comfortable with men drivers.
﻿Great company!, Culture Engagement to improve and be better each day (big focus on the areas where Uber was not so good in the past) cooperation between teams, Long working hours Stress level, Manage better working hours work life balance incentive working in standard hours
﻿Lots of miles and upkeep, It’s on your own time. You can make money as long as you know where you are going and best places. You have to ask around for this., A LOT of miles on your car. I fill up my gas every 2 days and change oil once a month. It looks like you make $20/hr but after gas and oil it’s abkut $15/hr., Better customer service for the drivers and passengers. Have a 1800 number
﻿One of the Best, Fantastic benefits absolutely top of the line. Catered lunches credits for Uber rides or UberEats very supportive work environment., A little bit disorganized in the HR department but totally willing to own mistakes., 
﻿uber drive, Can work when ever you want do not have fixed schedule, Can not make enough money to cover your cost. The hours you work and the money you make dose not much especially if you calculate the gas money your car maintenance how much your car is depreciating it is not worth it at all to drive for Uber, Fix the base fare price and the price per mile
﻿Hustle Work Culture, Good welfare Fun colleagues Good remuneration, High turnover rate Long working hours, 
﻿Average temp job to hold you over, Paid daily surges and meeting cool people, Takes about 40-60 percent of the money the customer paid upfront pricing new surge flat fees, Get it together this won’t last long at all!
﻿Cut off for no reason, There are a couple but I don't care to share anymore., You will be cut of after a certain time for no reason., Without warning or reason I was cut off from signing in. 4.98 driver rating. 2 years driving. Thanks a lot. I went to Lyft.
﻿Sub-par experience, Name brand on the resume generous about letting employees do overtime free lunches, Clear difference between full-time employees and contract employees (as in in a different part of the building with no access to the main section) poor facilities (everyone in a room with the toilet in the room and no windows) no sense of community in the contract section dismissive about the news about the poor Uber work experience., Give contract employees a better experience and perhaps they'd be more likely to stay longer especially the ones who have a lot of drive.
﻿Please do yourself a favor and do not drive for Uber eats, None. The company only cares about themselves., Uber eats is a con it’s self. I’ve had the experience of driving for Uber eats for only a couple of days and honestly the support team does not help you out at all and also they do not look out for you when all the issues are on them or on the restaurants. They take your money as quickly as possible but when it stems to them giving it back they rarely give anything back., I’ve been a customer support rep for more than six years and I’ve never dealt with such uncertainty and also lack of empathy with your support team. You all should take a training and understanding the internal customers needs and also take your mindset out of your office style and varmint and why don’t you try to drive for Uber eats and come out happy after one shift.
﻿I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Uber., The company cares for employees better than any other., If I truly have any complaints they are minor enough that I don't feel the need to express them., 
﻿Operations & Logistics Manager, Great benefits and workplace environment. Free breakfast lunch and snacks. Unlimited PTO is awesome., As company grew they started hiring cogs that would just fit into what they need and do things the way management would do it. They stopped celebrating diversity of experience. This cookie cutter model should be good for an IPO but will not be great for long-term success., Embrace creativity. Not only in your employees but in your work and management style. Not everything needs to be done the way your university professor taught you. Think for yourself.
﻿Very poor for contract employees, Contract basis no recognition no growth, Value the talent, 
﻿Modern day slave labor, Flexible to work whenever your schedule has an open window, For a company that calls it's drivers PARTNERS it doesn't compensate it's partners whom have invested their vehicles time and efforts properly. With 1/3- 1/2 of a partner's earning per week going to fuel tolls and general vehicle maintenance per week. It has built its wealth as a corporation off it's "PARTNERS" without paying them a living wage., Year end profit sharing would be a fairer trade off for building this platform off the backs of it's PARTNERS

﻿Incredible, Great environment incredible people great benefits. The best company I've worked for., Nothing so far I love to work there., 
﻿Analytics & Insights, - Always interesting problems to solve - The people are great to work with - Work/life balance has become much more of a priority, - Can be stressful at times but all jobs can, - Keep up the good work on the progress towards work/life balance. You can feel the shift happening and people are happier and more productive.
﻿Jumped on this fast moving ship and enjoying every moment of it, - Compelling mission: this is a culture shaping company that is transforming how people and products move globally - Team members have a bias for action and getting results - Minimal politics; we're here to get stuff done - Flexibility: get your stuff done no need for face time - Pace of growth and change keeps things exciting, - Some parts of the company are still disorganized as we transition from agile decentralized startup to sustainable company of scale moving in one direction. Not suitable for people who are not comfortable with change and ambiguity., Ensure we IPO successfully.
﻿What's good and bad about Uber!, They might let go of you easily, If an employee had a challenge he shouldn't be fired but rather coached!, 
﻿Top management need fix, - Dara is doing the right thing. Period. - Still understaffed + too many inexperienced people + massive biz growth = huge amount of career opportunities - Lots of smart energetic people committed to give their best. Good work environment. - Goal setting process and PSC are starting to ramp up in a positive way so far - Extremely flexible schedule just deliver bold results - As a woman I feel respected and empowered..., - Leaders are a problem. It’s a common opinion that we have to fix top management positions. COO RGMs GMs and other senior positions in S&P Comms CommOps are way too Uber 1.0. Even Barney that joined 6 months ago hired by Dara is very criticized by the lack of inspiration and leadership. - The ops org lacks strategy and efficiency. Barney has stated his 5 priorities but there’s no clear path to get there. Operational..., Dara you need to be closer to Barney at least for a few months. He’s a jerk sometimes and people don’t like that. I’ve heard a lot of similar feedback from people that had meetings/1:1s with him. Barney is mean far from being a humble leader and that is a problem!
﻿Be prepared, - Thorough interview process allows you to meet the team and understand the role better before you land the job - If you are used to being in a fast-paced environment be prepared to be in an even faster-paced one with a lot to learn (conceptual and technical) as you go along, - It can get very technical and decisions need to be made fast which can be daunting at first, 
﻿Driver, Awesome experience. It was fun., No cons here. It was great., 
﻿Five star driver, I have work outside and have hard labor all my life I worked construction and landscape since a child also I owned my own landscape business for 7 years!, Never really had down side until the economy went down and people started take care their own yards, Try to make the best out out if every situation turn negative into positive and always get the job done.
﻿Uber Eats Delivery Driver Review, Nice to work when you want to and shut off the app when you are done for the day. Good flexibility. Opportunity to earn extra cash IF the customer decides to tip., I recently started delivering for Uber Eats and am extremely disappointed because of a few things. #1. The pay breaks down to less than minimum wage at $7.50 in average an hour because most customers don’t tip. Uber pays a SMALL amount for your drive and only status paying once you have picked up the food but does not take into consideration the drive it took you to get the food. 2. Tipping is listed as ‘optional’ on..., Encourage tipping! Automatically caluculate a small percentage which is fair for any food service so that your drivers can at least earn minimum wage. Show Uber drivers the general location of where the food will be delivered BEFORE making the driver accept the job. Allow drivers to rate customers. IF a customer has too many negative ratings don’t allow them to use the service.
﻿Regional Marketing Manager, Smart people good benefits working culture in Asia is awesome, Decentralized/localized management works better; too much power on the HQ or Regional side is making Uber more bureaucratic than ever. Also does not move faster than other competitors to hit the right pain point at each locale., Hand back the power to local team.
﻿Please Fix Manager Problem, Good pay & perks. Lots of things to learn. Kind and smart engineers surround you., Managers tend to have too many people to be effective. Some are completely incompetent. Those with smaller teams tend to do better. Work life balance is difficult on some teams. Has started becoming very political., All tech managers should know the stack and listen to their engineers. Some of them need to learn how to speak to others in a professional manner.
﻿Driving for Uber should be your last resort, you make your own hours, Everything else. You will earn less than minimum wage sometimes dealing with very rude people who don't care about you at all. Most riders do not tip. Especially UberEATS. NO ONE tips in uberEATS., Please leave the company and let the ship sink.
﻿Driver, Make extra money on your own time, Uber shut our apps off here in Vegas to do extensive background checks with no warning about this time frame. It’s been over 2 weeks now and my income has been greatly affected. Uber doesn’t care about their drivers. Drive for Lyft. The Uber costumers are self entitled and don’t tip ! They don’t care about your car nor do they respect you. If I could give them a 0 I would., Care about your drivers. Some of us drive for a living! Apologize for this inconvenience and compensate us! Get people in costumer service that speak English!
﻿A great trip but a bumpy ride, - I have learned an enormous amount about both software engineering and how to be effective in an organization the size of Uber. - Uber seems to really be making an effort to do right by its various stakeholders in the wake of several controversies surrounding the company in 2017. - Excellent opportunities for career growth. Uber rewards effort and impact with generosity and fairness. - The business continues to grow..., - The company is so huge that learning to be diplomatic when working with other teams is a necessity. Sometimes the people you have to work with will not want to help you but you have to find a way to deliver anyway. - There was a period in 2017 when the company was in a deep cultural crisis. That was a weird time and things are very different now than they were pre-crisis. Uber is a little more grown up but a little..., Continue to focus on doing the right thing for your customers drivers and employees. Make an effort to help employees more with work-life balance.
﻿Uber Eats Sales Executive, Great team rewarding work great office and perks, The work can be a bit repetitive and sometimes boring, 
﻿delivery driver, flexible drive around you schedule get to know the city, low mile pay no tips customer lie, take care your driver more incentive people to tip the driver
﻿The definition of a love/hate relationship, *Smartest most talented crew of people you will ever work with *Perks like Uber credits and in-house catering *Never a dull day -- you will learn more than you'd ever expect, *Constant media attention and internal drama is soul-crushing *Underpaid and overworked *The need to always be "on" -- it takes a toll no matter who you are, 
﻿Pretty good way to earn money while in school, Very flexible...work whatever times you want. Pretty busy in the Scarborough and Beaches Toronto area so I average 20$ to 25$ an hour. On a slow day it would be between 15$ to be 18$ an hour. It's also nice you don't have a supervisor or anyone bothering you lol it's just me an my boyfriend. We do this together for an extra income. I would say it's worth for a short term job while I am in school., It's obviously not good for my car and it's a disappointment of how many people DO NOT give tips. I would say 1 or 2 people will give a tip a week :/ Also you need to consider your gas. I have a pretty good car and I use about 20$ to 30$ on gas if I do a full day of uber. Uber Downtown Toronto is not worth it!!!To much traffic and people living in condos often make it difficult to get in and then go up their unit..., Drivers make it possible for the amount of money Uber earns. So it would be nice to add extra incentives for the fact that our cars are really used up with doing this. Other than that I think it's a good job. Customer service is great. Whenever I needed help I was helped in a quick and professional manner.
﻿uber driver, its flexible work whenever you want, The cost of the flexibility is you get to drive your car to the ground. Pay for gas maintenance and deal with drunk and sometimes rude passengers. Majority are nice then there are the few that you need to kick out of your car there are also some that will make up false complaints to try to get an free fare from uber. If anyone is planning to do it full time i recommend buying an cheaper vehicle for it., 
﻿Uber: Better for New Hires Than It Used To Be, amazing insurance great benefits and employee resource groups for LGBT employees, Overzealous company culture - if you criticize anything at all you're seen as a detractor, Stop picking favorites. Integrate the Greenlight Hub into the Uber ethos if you expect to retain employees.
﻿Awful Management Awful Financial Sense, Management is grossly incompetent and makes awful financially ridiculous choices. I would never invest in this company, Be more transparent genuine and, 
﻿Financing Specialist Manager, Salary was good also the health benefits, NOt an ethical company to work for, 
﻿Do it for 6 months tops!, Make your own schedule. Decent compensation for unskilled labor., You have to endure so much abuse from so many people. Between the riders pedestrians other drivers and even first responders you will take up drinking and smoking. With regard to Boston riders I have never met so many inconsiderate surly and abusive people in my life. If a girl under 25 gets in your car just stfu and drive like it's a test or you will get 1 star and some made up complaint. Worst of all..., Back your drivers! Stop letting people give out bad ratings for no reason and make up bs stories.
﻿It's great if you have another job, Meeting different people choosing your own schedule no heavy lifting., You probably should get another part time job or full time because there are times when it is slow., Your concern about drivers is not sincere due to the expense you put into self driving cars.
﻿Great Experience, The company has massively changed since Dara was appointed as CEO, Not for now. - .............................................................................., 
﻿Business has reached maturity stage., 1. Too much wear on vehicle 2. high taxes 3. low pay 4. dealing with customers, increase pay,

﻿Great part time gig! Made $1050 in the first week only worked 28hrs., Get to network with people from every where. You can take it with you to any city and you are the boss!!, Since I have been with them for 2 and a half years never really had a con maybe more bonuses., More quest trips/Bonues
﻿Retail Operations Manager, Uber is full of passionate and super smart people. Everyone believes in the company's mission and works hard to get it done. Uber has taken great steps to improve the company's culture. Offices are full of amenities and they foster multiple activities to encourage diversity and inclusion of people and ideas., Senior management is still old school. In my personal experience they value big shiny things over everything else. The way to get them to notice you is by making noise and fuzz and not a constant good work., Stop thinking of big projects and game changers. The road to an IPO and a world-class company is more about consistency in performance indicators and not big loud changes.
﻿Great though somewhat difficult as contractor, It is great to know that a huge user base consumes your work. Great people to work with who are generally happy and willing to collaborate., Working in such a large company can make it very hard to have a good grasp on the big picture. Teams all have deadlines so cross-team collaboration needs to be planned well in advance., 
﻿Great experience working at Uber, Smart people great mission challenging projects, work life balance improving but not great can be too political, 
﻿Culture Add, A culture that incorporates coaching mentoring and diversity. A constant flood of support is available. You will never feel alone., Sometimes it can be a high-stress environment which is relatively dependent on the projects at hand., Great work always with ever available support system and the willingness to give team members space to explore create and grow.
﻿Amazing company leadership and colleuges, Uber is an amazing company to work for. Dhara has done such an amazing job of throwing out the negatives that existed before and focusing on what is most important the employees and culture. Unlimited PTO is obviously a plus (as long as you are getting your work done) and we have a leader I can 100% stand behind. They feed us everyday and all my colleagues are great. No complaints here., If you aren't working for Uber chances are you haven't experience the change that has happened since Dhara took over. Some candidates have a negative outlook on Uber but this will change with more time., Keep doing an amazing job and focusing on the front line. We appreciate your hard work and see the changes.
﻿Delivery driver, Working when you want to work, Like many people say the pay is horrible. First of all working and then Miami / Fort Lauderdale area you never and I mean never get that option for a boost pay or the option for a quest promotion. I've been doing the delivery driving for about 8 months and have never seen a boost and I work almost everyday but even when I'm not working I check that and they're still never boost or Quest.

﻿You don't make as much as you think, Uber is really flexible you can work on your own schedule., The price of gaswear and tear on the car and sitting around waiting for a call all means you don't really make much.

﻿Operations coordinator, , , 
﻿Uber ATG, , , 
﻿Data Analyst, Strong team and good management, I don't like the so-called Uber 2.0, 
﻿You don’t get paid enough for all the driving, Put in a lot of miles in car They don’t pay your drive to the restaurant If you’re in a little small city like me you won’t make much, Pay the employee for the time they spend driving to the restaurant, 
﻿Review, Talented people Great environment Inspiring company Freedom to take action English speaker company (good to practise if you are not a native english speaker) Extreme flexible schedule, Sometimes hierarchy gets confused (startup feelings X huge company) Way too many project to deal at the same time, 
﻿mileage pay, flexible hours self employed tax write off, In my opinion 60 cents per mile in Houston is frankly a joke., value the drivers time and cost of running a vehicle
﻿Awesome company, Benefits are really really good Advancement opportunities are really good Work on interesting problems, Can get lost in the fray If you're not good at managing relationships you may not move up, 
﻿Uber Eats Driver, 1) Flexible hours 2) State of the Art technology 3) Excellent way to stay sharp; focused; interact with people, 1) Higher reimbursement for each trip would be better, Increase amounts paid to drivers to keep them motivated to work.
﻿Great Company not so great people, Great culture nice vibe Uber sounds cool, I worked at Uber in 2 position during the past year and a half I was really disappointed on the management how they handled things the working hours are many and tiring and the payment is really low for the effort. They don't know how to value employees., Value more your drivers and employees
﻿Driver, Pick own hours Ok Pay Work whenever or wherever you want., Could be dangerous based on area and or time of travel., Let us know where we are headed before we pick up the client and where they are going. Not knowing can be dangerous to both parties involved.
﻿Make money whenever you want to!, The flexibility. You are your own boss. It's your business!, Hours you need to put in to make a living at it. Wear and tear on your vehicle. People not tipping the way they should., 
﻿If I could do uber ride sharing there would be more than 3 stars., Work when you want to work alone, Your car is going to go through A LOT of wear and tear uber support does not really support you app is difficult to navigate Ubers navigation needs a lot of work cannot update bank account information starting to notice that you must accept all ubereats orders or they will not give you any trips to complete more incentives for drivers., Drivers need more attention with support and earnings. Uber needs to pay the drivers more.
﻿Great company & culture management so-so, - Great extras such as free food - Great people - Nice culture & office, - The management was kind of full of themselves - They claim to be very open minded but heard two managers talk condescendingly about some of their employees. But I can't say that this is a reflection on the entire company maybe it was just those two., 
﻿Great company great mission!, Inspiring mission people and product, Rapid growth has left organizational debt to clean up,

﻿Uber Eats, Picking up an order from restaurant right around the corner but delivering 25 or more minutes away...not being able to see beforehand where the delivery is going. Sometimes the navigation doesn't take an easy route..makes the driver go in big circles...apartment delivery is the worst..sometimes not accurate information..don't get paid full amount when going through tollway... Don't get paid driving to restaurant..., Pay tolls completely don't hold it against driver for canceling because delivery is too far from restaurant...be more supportive to drivers, 
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule and work enviroment, Little to no support or input. Arbitrary pay cuts..., Treat drivers fairly
﻿Contract position at Uber, , , 
﻿Cleverly hidden slavery and should be illegal., There are absolutely no pros. If you see a 5 star review it is fake., Working for little to no money. SOMETIMES LOSING MONEY., Quit your job
﻿Don’t do it. Trust me. All the reviews are self generated. Drivers get screwed., Flexible that’s about it nothing more., Fees paid to UBER. Booking Fees and service fee. Don’t fall into the trap. If you make 600 a week UBER WILL PROFIT THE SAME AMOUNT?? Uber takes too much off the top. It’s ridiculous. The driver has ALL the risk. Risk of accident risk of tickets wear and tear on car gas and then get paid almost half of the earnings. You may make 14$ an hour not including all of the wear and tear along with gas. Only good if you are..., Pay your drivers more or will never get reliable drivers. Business will fail.
﻿UBER left SG, Difference between full timers Others had gym benefits some didn't, No point at this time. At least come down to Singapore to let us know you were selling., 
﻿Not worth it, You can work when ever you want., The pay is poor at best. Less than $10/hr when you factor in millege maintainence & gas., Stop taking an undisclosed amount of money from drivers to help pay for your many lawsuits
﻿A joke, Flexibility Flexibility Flexibility Flexibility Flexibility., Everything else but the flexibility, Simplify...stop with the nonsense promos and have something that is actually worth someone wanting to go out and drive. Get rid of long pick up fee policy where drivers don't get compensated if you're on a set destination. Start helping your "partners" with vehicle maintenance. You have too much unnecessary BS.
﻿2.3 boost is a joke! Looking for suckers!, You make your own hours. You can earn emergency money for getting pimped out., No money made The app lies Uber and UberEats is for suckers!, Don't lie and say there's a 2.3 boost them have the location in the middle of the ocean. We may be desperate cuz we need the money but we're not that dumb... Or are we?
﻿Uber review, Inconsistent pay; wear and tear on your car, Raise the percentage that drivers receive or raise the rates, 
﻿Numerous problems as a Uber Eats Delivery Driver., Work on your own schedule, -Wasting time and gas by attempting to pick up restaurant order that has previously been picked up from another driver; Horrible customer support; Low Pay; Lack of accountability from Uber and no chance of compensation when they mess up, Provide actual support to drivers when Uber app malfunctions. For 4 months I have talked to numerous representatives and sent many messages about being assigned deliveries that were previously picked up by another driver. After driving to the restaurant and being told that it has been picked up I am forced to cancel the order which burns through gas and puts additional wear and tear on my vehicle for nothing. The order...
﻿Uber driver, Freedom of schedule fun to meet new people learned the city well., Drunk patrons some days were very slow fear of getting in a car accident, 
﻿Atrocious, Work your own hours and when it suits you., Terrible driver support. Unable to talk to anyone other than someone in India about the current job being delivered., Start paying attention to your drivers.
﻿The best is ahead of us, Challenging and interesting work with real-world impact., Big company mindset is sinking in. There are some reasonable tradeoffs being made around this but if you really can't function in a large org this is going to disturb you., 
﻿ATG is a mess, Good pay free lunches whatever equipment you want for your development environment a chance to make self-driving cars many good employees., Absolutely toxic environment upper management pitting managers against each other disorganized yet over managed teams no clear path to grow as an employee new head of software too focused on details constant reorganization. This is a very bad place to work., Slow down ATG spending until you can figure out what you are doing.
﻿MId Market Account Rep, love this place the people and the energy. Come here to work. Hard work is rewarded. Management is open to ideas, Not much.. So many good things to say,

﻿Don't Be An Expert Seriously, Coworkers are amazing people the partners are what makes this job the benefits are seriously the best I have ever seen., Unprofessionalism lack of experience HR department is in various locations and not on site budget issues a bunch of things you'll come across you should not have come across in a entry level position., Stop hiring people based on their education level and start evaluating their professionalism and if they have basic customer service skills this job has so much added stress do to management not being able to perform at a very basic level of approval it is so sad upper management (executives) need to start caring about these Uber Hubs because as of now they do absolutely nothing and it seems as if they did not know...
﻿An amazing and inspiring place to work, I love being able to work around truly passionate people who are ready to change the world. The culture is great free snacks and food is big plus. I had the opportunity to take ownership of projects within my first month, The hours are much longer than any other job I've worked in but this is expected to change as we continue hiring more help, Keep up the great work! I'm excited to see the company grow and mature and hope that we don't lose the strong culture we have now
﻿Uber Driver, Flexible hours improves social skills as well as driving experience work as often and as long as you want meet tons of people- have been offered several job positions., Does not offer insurance income is not guaranteed car wear and tear no control of false "bad reviews" (some people will do this in order to get a 'free' ride)- affects total rating (which is a big deal from what I have gathered from riders), Health insurance! Improve security for drivers who are given false bad review so driver can have free ride (notify driver to get their side of story and add more tedious steps for freeloaders)
﻿The best job I will ever have, Fast paced innovative and somewhere you can make a real business impact. Employees are given an enormous amount of responsibility commensurate to their overall experience and are trusted and encouraged to be autonomous creative and impactful. For all the well-publicized problems the company has had we're moving steadily and consistently in the right direction and the New York office at least is a happy positive..., Career pathing is pretty nebulous and there's not a clearly defined path forward for people working in remote markets. The brunt of the opportunities tend to be in the regional hubs like DC San Francisco or Amsterdam. There's a huge amount of scope for professional growth and learning but it doesn't always come with a new title and a pat on the back. The flip-side of having a lot of independence is that there's..., 
﻿Best Culture, Purely tech-enabled company - Brilliant co-workers - Well structured process - Great learning and growth opportunities - Great perks - Coolest office I literally never got a negative vibe while working in the office all colleagues are highly energetic and understanding., none that I could find, Keep doing the awesome work that you are doing
﻿do not believe the hype, own boss mostly nice people, upredictable job requests low pay no support, 
﻿Pricing Analyst, Flexible WFH work from other offices/vacation policy Incredibly democratic and meritocratic in nature Coworkers are smart driven individuals, HR department is a mess, 
﻿Uber Partner, Driver investing to work just for your basic needs., Full investment - you will owe taxes. Called driver partner with no stock dividends not from preferred for sure or even common stock. Is an automated dispatch company with an central operating system. Driver takes all the risk. Pay is very low., No
﻿Great Opportunity, I go when I can and I can make milk money in an hour. I feel like I will never be without again as long as I can drive for Uber. I have met some amazingly sweet people and some very interesting awesome people. It's an experience I will never forget., Sometimes the maps are a little off. My background check came back with somebody else and their charges of battery I had to prove that I was not that person before I could drive. It took several months. But I'm very happy to be driving with them now., 
﻿Great place to be employed, To be an Uber driver you have so much flexibility. You have a chance to make full time money working part time. It’s your own business !, People don’t always tip when they should.....the surge areas are not always idealistic and convenient. But I believe ride costs are going up . People in general seem unappreciative., Increase delivery costs. I’m sure I’m not the only one who went above and beyond to find a place park wait a long time for food and have trouble parking at the establishment again all for 3.00. This is not reasonable .

﻿Needs less drivers, When I first started I was getting alot of delivery's now I will turn on the app and wait almost an hour to get a delivery I worked 7 hours got 6 orders. Ended up making way less then min wage ☹️. They don't fix acceptance rate when the app fails and they always send a email saying the issue was resolved when it wasn't. No payment to drive to pick up order., Pay the driver for driving figure away so we are not waiting so long to get orders, 
﻿Amazing job places, salary could be more competitive (by the way is more than adeguate to the standards on the market), good environment and management free foods,

Things like ownership are fairly clear people move fast and you really feel like you are delivering something..., Lack of some developer productivity infrastructure - I've been wanting a virtual machine with a static IP for a while and I can't get it yet. But they are aware acknowledge the issue and are fixing it., Keep doing whatever you are doing.
﻿Uber Eats, Flexible easy good app and simple to use. Allows for you to make your own hours, Occasional angry customer and you have to do a lot of trips to make any good money,

﻿Convenient, Instant pay option Instant money, Wear on car and gas Mileage No raises, Wish there was a raise after 6 month
﻿Rate could be changed, Flexible hours that you start and end at your will, They take 20% of your fare, Take 10-15%
﻿Software engineering intern, - extremely interesting work for intern projects - very good mentoring, - nothing really full time pay is slightly low compared t other tech companies, better offers for new grads
﻿Promises more than delivers, Total schedule flexibility easy to fit around other work., Actual pay is usually less than advertised except for very busy weekends, Factor in self-employment tax and depreciation of a vehicle plus fuel cost and realize that Uber drivers are sometimes making less than minimum wage and often not much more than that.
﻿Ubereats Delivery, Flexible schedule. Goods on the weekends. Doesn't pay that well on weekdays., No promotion benefits. Customers and restaurant can delay your work. Inconsistent., 
﻿Great place to work, Smart people fast paced business, Very intense could be extremely busy at times, 
﻿Convinced All My Friends to Delete Uber, Just the fact that you worked for a big-name company, Pay is a joke no running water no bathroom no real office dangerous neighborhood surrounded by homeless people bolts falling from the highway above our heads horrible people to work with felt unsafe walking home at night. The rumors about Uber are true., Good thing the CEO quit his job but I don't think Uber as a whole will ever redeem its reputation.
﻿Made less than $4/he before taxes and gas, None. There are seriously no pros. Uber should be shut down., Everything. Pay is less than half the minimum wage., Shut down business
﻿Growth Marketing Manager, Cultural values are very important huge opportunity to grow and develop new things ideas and projects, Some process are not defined as any start up however they are working on it. Career path and job levels doesn't exist super flat organization., 
﻿Good company, , ,

﻿Really Great part time gig for the money, Great flexibility and cash pay out is instant, Dont know where the order is going til after u pick it up, Let the driver see how much hes getting and where it's going before picking up food
﻿Great place to learn and change things!, - People are genuinely good smart and passionate about the company and changing the world (when I meet up with folks who left they always speak about how they miss the company and teams they see it as a badge of honor to have worked there) - You have lots of impact on what you do. You get to build! - Lots of changes happening especially after 2017. The company is making important strides to be better for employees..., - Leaders can be young and inexperienced. - Sometimes things are done too hastily (e.g. selling off business operations in other regions) with little planning considerations for impacts to employees., Need to continue the upskilling of leaders in leadership and management. Many folks are new and if we could focus on talent development it'll go a long way! Please don't sell off any regions to competitors...
﻿Marketing Manager, - Inclusive and welcoming environment for women and LGBTQ+ people - Company is growing very fast and you have possibility to grow too, - Excess information can be overwhelm, 
﻿The Greatest Place to Work, Most of the employees have autonomy capacity and are very committed to work., Due to the need of high-qualified workers we can notice the lack of diversity within some teams., 
﻿Senior Marketing Manager, be part of a revolucionary company that is changing how people and things move from one point to another company that is worry about their employees and work evry they to make it a better place to work, Still under construction so thinks change a lot, 
﻿Marketing Manager, - A chance to work for an impactful company that produces mass changes in our cities and economy - Connect with multiple talented people from around the world - Work on challenging projects, - Overwhelming at first - Low bandwidth for teams, 
﻿Marketing Manager, Even after being here for almost 1 year and half I keep been exposed to new and challenging experiences - I believe I had never learned so much in such short time. I super recommend this position in Uber for those who are willing to take their career to the next level and give your best., In order to take best advantage of all the opportunities company has to offer you should dedicate yourself and put your best game on., 
﻿Best Company in the world!, There's no other place where you have collaborative work. People like to get together in order to solve problems help one another with the projects. It's a place where you can grow up professionally involving yourself in a lot of different projects. A company focused on the future of cities., There is competition. But I don't see it as a con once you're pushed to give your best., 
﻿Marketing Manager, Uber gives a lot opportunities for growing professionally and inside the company and working for a market like Brazil makes it even better as we have a lot of challenges in the country and the company will help us to overcome it., Sometimes people here expects too much from everyone so the work/life balance needs some attention., 
﻿Great internship, , , 
﻿Uber Driver, , , 
﻿Uber driver, Not fast making money job, You should really high the ammount of money a driver gets in Miami. It is really bad compared to everywhere else and I know because I have to travel a lot for my other job and I talk to other uber drivers., 
﻿Some cultural change but a number of bad seeds, Room for growth but many pockets without senior management oversight leave, Many pockets without senior management support leave culture controlled by inexperienced lower-level managers Some negative LGBTQ-related experiences - but again due to poor low-level managers Management decisions made largely by tenure (e.g. growth with "the rocketship"), In addition to training lower-level managers evaluate them more frequently/promote the IC tracks for not-great-fits; they have a crazy impact on employee experience
﻿Reform the Star Rating System, It's easy to add on top of another job since you can ostensibly make your own hours., Lyft has this same problem: I got deactivated for having a low rating but here's the thing you can rate your driver from 1 to 5 stars but a rating of 4.6 or lower gets you deactivated. And here's the other thing: the customers are not made aware of that fact. I get it I'm an average ride. I don't play music my car is old and ratty-looking I don't make conversation very much etc. I'll bet my average rating is 3 or..., Change the star rating to a simple thumbs up or thumbs down so that there's an equal number of "good enough" and "not good enough" options and the rating don't slant negative. Or else lower the deactivation threshold to something reasonable like 3.0. OR or else remind the passengers that deactivation happens at 4.6 every time you ask them for a rating so that they actually know that there's only one "good enough" rating...
﻿Head of Recruiting India, Amazing place to work. Smart colleagues., None that I could think, You guys are doing great
﻿Fun Part-Time Job, , , 
﻿Decent Option Between Jobs, Able to work whenever you want no experience required, Tough on your car People can make your life hard, 
﻿Do not bother working for Uber as a courier. They exploit their couriers for profit., You can delete the app quickly You can go offline when it is bad., Awful cheap customers Worst support -never do they offer a solution. Cheap pay, You are the worst delivery platform i have ever encountered. Your customers are cheap and rude. Your support is incompetent and useless. First I was accused of using a car at excessive speeds. I do not own a car. Then you asked me to verify my identity three times a day Frustrating. You offer low pay and you do not build morale by having so many people talk bad about delivery. You make a profit by taking advantage...
﻿Had an energetic challenging and priceless experience as an intern, 1. Very comfortable and fancy atmosphere 2. Even interns can actively participate in or build up the projects they want 3.

﻿Uber Driver, You can work when you like., This company is very greedy and deceptive. They cheat drivers out of their bonuses and support is awful. They do not understand your issues when you call them on the phone because there's a language barrier. I just had them deactivate my driver account about an hour ago. I have been driving for Uber ever since they started here in Las Vegas and I have been treated poorly not to mention I have always been a 4.8 to 5.0..., NOTHING giving advice to management doesn't matter and it won't change anything I'm done!

﻿Senior Community Operations Manager, Autonomy Great Leadership Abundant opportunities for personal growth, Can't think of any right now, 
﻿Stay away. This company doesn’t care about you at all they can kick you out any minute, Your own boss but “customers is your boss”, Unfair trip pricing slow days and Uber support is very weak and take reports seriously even if they are false and they can fire you anytime, CEO should admire and appreciate drivers that worked and build Uber over a long period like my case. You don’t care about drivers that worked hard for you you can kick them out any minute because of hateful and racist customers

﻿Awesome Job and place to work, Work timing flexibility no need to go to office is u r in sales. just go directly for meetings. nice incentives. Nice office and supportive peers., the strategies used by company are based on the work done by other companies they are not at all applying their brains., stop copying the competitors do your own study and make strategies.
﻿Fast Paced - Ever Changing, Really smart people a lot of learning transparent, Cut throat Low employee engagement People can easily be left behind, Invest more in engagement
﻿Working at Uber is not a long term career, You get to make your own hours You don't have a boss watching at all times You can get paid immediately or elect to wait for the weekly check Good way to build connections and network Tech/ driver support has become efficient and prompt Good source of short term income, Not properly compensated for the cost of driving Like with most jobs you have to occasionally deal with rude customers Pay taxes on the money earned Not something i would recommend people do for a career or long periods., Pay more or offer to help with car maintenance

﻿Low Pay for Independence, Working your own schedule meeting cool people., Below minimum wage during slow periods., If you make under minimum wage for the hour then they should match the pay.
﻿Travis is a real mensch!, I don't understand what everyone is talking about in the press. I've really enjoyed my experience at Uber as a Product Manager and had the opportunity to work face to face with Travis often. He was a true visionary and inspired those around him with a calm demeanor and fair management., Company had limited cash at times but that's what you'd expect as a growing startup., Continue to focus on self driving!
﻿Team Management, Great benefits nice environment good products., Poor and very loose management especially on the new Data Analysis team. People do not have much to do and often times ideal and you can never find them around their desk., Improve your management and get to know if the team is wasting company’s resources and not contributing!!!
﻿I’m sold on Uber 2.0, * Lots of smart people to learn from and opportunities solve difficult problems. The initial learning curve is steep but resulted in intense knowledge gain. First class tech stack to work in with powerful tools to help you be productive. * Freedom to work on projects you find interesting if you can prove it will be impactful. Relatively little red tape in starting a project once you have validated that it will be useful..., Uber is still trying to establish a new culture by incorporating what made the old Uber successful while making the changes needed to become a world class tech company. This new culture hasn’t quite taken hold yet but the majority of the company is getting behind it., Keep taking big bold bets while continuing to invest in established products. Enable employees to grow and develop alongside recruiting senior leaders and engineers to help build the next platform. Be more vocal about the future vision for the company so everyone will get bought it.

﻿Driver, Super flexible you can work whenever you want. Can get paid whenever you want otherwise its weekly. Some rides are great because you can meet new people., Sometimes unable to get delivery's for a whole hour. Short trips in unboosted areas can suck. And sometimes when you go to a boosted area you don't get a single delivery for a period of time., Show where active hot-spots are it would be great to see other drivers just to relive congestion of them. So if there are a good amount of drivers in one area then i can move somewhere else.
﻿Love to work, Amazing environment good technology best place to work can learn on lot of tools. Flexible timing, There is nothing like that, 
﻿Independent Contractor, Over the past year I've had the pleasure of meeting wonderful people through the job. I learned to adapt to different moods and behaviors from customers. I learn a great deal by listening to clients and what they have to say., There's a lot of Uber drivers out there which creates competition. Wait time in between fares., Create better gas discounts.
﻿Not worth it, Weekly pay Can see what you've earned instantly Flexible hours, Terrible driver app Low rates UberEats unable to see where is drop off until after food pick up Send far for pick up and near by drop off - no compensation for milage for pick up,

﻿I have been working at Uber for 3 months now, It has been a very good experience with lots of opportunities to learn in a very fast paced growing company. -Great office and people attitude -High-performance team, -Constant changes require fast adaptation, 
﻿Driving for Uber, There are none to even mention it, So many don't even bother., Take a good care of driver it's a PowerForce for Uber business. In a small City like Wichita Falls Uber driver working full-time cannot make a living. Ridiculous.
﻿Restaurant Partnership Representative, the perk of saying you work at "uber", treated horribly and completely ostracized from the rest of the uber community. they treat contractors like sub-humans and make them sit in a different part of the office don't give them the same benefits yet make them work as hard or harder than full time employees. working at uber was extremely toxic and bad for my health., 
﻿Uber, Worked at Google Facebook G&E as a contingent and hated it. I worked as a contingent for uber as well But they seen my value and converted me as FTE! I appreciate they took the time and effort to realize my value, Too much red tape now and days, 
﻿Mixed Bag, - Great work environment young coworkers cool office - Flexible work hours - Opportunities to learn new skills, - Can be organizationally disorganized due to rapid growth - Job posting and actual job responsibilities are not always aligned, 
﻿Good for a temporary Part Time job, flexible hours drive as much as you like, horrible customer and driver support wear and tear on your vehicle, You should use some of the money you're making to invest in employees for the customer service branch of your business. When I email a concern I should not get back a generic email where the computer system picked out key words and sent what they thought would be best.
﻿Unless you are driving an electric I can't see how you make more than poverty wages, Flexibility in when you want to drive. If you like music and talking to people you have lots of time for both, Overcoming the hurdle of paying all of your own FICA Medicare etc taxes is rough., Just make drivers employees.
﻿delivery driver, work any time make it work for you, time is not valued they put a cap on how much you make depending if theres alot of drivers, better system
﻿Best First Job, - Growth/Career Path & Opportunites - Autonomy - Benefits - Work Environment - Good Management - Upholds Cultural Norms, - Fast-paced environment - Unexpected decisions, Keep up the good work!

﻿Uber driver, Flexible schedule easy to use the app and verge popular, Getting in touch with them is horrible they treat their drivers really bad, Pay attention to the drivers and treat them the same way as customers
﻿My Experience @ Uber, Freedom of work Young and energetic team opportunity to explore the innovative thoughts and ideas Good Human Resource management facilities to employees and good work life balance., Silo culture and Surprise organizational decision which suffocates the employee on his job security., Synchronization and silo culture should not be a part of Uber environment.
﻿Safety Investigations, Uber credits monthly stocked kitchen free to enjoy and a laid back work environment. Good health benefits., Poor leadership. Leadership and overall management didn't exist. Most are young employees doing very little and everything is over looked. Employees handling the most sensitive issues (sexual assault physical assault fatalities) come into work dirty talk about how much weed they smoke and how much they drink nightly. If you are an uneducated unprofessional person with poor hygiene you'll fit in. It's..., Hire proper management. Run the company and it's people like a business. Enforce policy onto EVERYONE not just the people you don't like. Stop hiring people who didn't complete high school. Value good employees and fire the rest. BUILD your people and create a comfortable work environment. Stop making these half thought-out ideas into new policies just for them to fail. I can keep going..
﻿Expert, Insurance is great. PTO and sick time are available., Management is skewed. Not much room for advancement. To get anything done its going to take weeks before you get answers., Communication is vital to have a successful team. Give every employee a chance to become better and that starts with hiring well rounded supervisors.

﻿Love working at Uber!, Uber is a diverse costumer obsessed company. We don't work we hustle. The fast-paced environment makes everyday exciting., Since we are moving at such a fast pace role lines are blurry. Most people here were hired to do one thing and are actually doing something different., 
﻿Marketing in Latam, Highly competitive groundbreaking and meaningful work you get to work along with the smartest people ever and you get to see how your work impacts cities directly. Open and free kitchen with above average benefits., Work-life balance can be hard to achieve due to the high competitiveness it might be difficult to advance in your career., 
﻿Uber corporate MX - Marketing team - Great place to work!, Great benefits and in-office perks. Very knowledgeable and smart team even at the lower levels there is people with significant experience and a ton of drive. The company vision is also very easy to buy into it really feels like we are shaping the future in a big way. Specifically in marketing Uber provides the resources and demand that you need to actually send trends and innovate within the industry., Can be a rough start it is a big company that grew very fast. Some team processes are still designed for smaller teams while at the same there is a lack of communication between some areas . This makes it a bit tough to navigate at first though a) you get there and b) there are efforts from leadership to update structure and roles to avoid this problem., Do not assume the decision making process is transparent at all levels promote team communication to ensure resources are used to the max and duplication is minimized.
﻿One of the most dynamic companies in Mexico with top talent and room for sharing your best ideas, Teamwork impact and relevance of the projects amazing cultural environment benefits & compensation. Real management and leadership focused on employee growth, Constantly changing structure and quick turns in the paths (Dynamic environment). Due to the startup nature of the company many processes need to be built yet, 
﻿Driver, Uber is good to work wit it's flexible, Nothing to advice,

﻿Best Place, People here are always trying to make you feel comfortable with our environment and providing us the tools we need to be successful, Need to have Bonus, 
﻿Great Company!, The culture is very different from where it was last year now it's much more positive. Our CEO is very smart humble and human. It's great to work in a company that is shaping the future. All the employees I have met are very professional and willing to do the right thing. You can definitely feel how the company is changing from a "start-up" to a more "mature" company. Really focused in Diversity and Inclusion..., The company grew up so fast that a lot of things were done without planning or without taking into consideration how that grow could impact the structure or employees. In the Bay Area we have more than 5 offices so employees need to be moving between this offices and it's a waste of time. I have met employees who really like the "start-up vibe" and they are starting to feel frustrated because we are becoming more "corporate"..., Keep up the good work! There are a lot of things to do but we are on the right path!
﻿Operations, good workplace with a fast-paced environment, Long hours the event structure for events is still poorly managed, Keep up the good work

﻿Wasted days and nights, Can't think of any other than daily pay outs, Stress property damage low pay expensive to operate.., Increase partner percentage and share the actual cost of operations.
﻿Three months in - nothing but good experiences, Great compensation package and some of the best benefits in NYC tech. Smart people with a shared vision. Strong cultural values (yes really!). Excellent work/life balance. Bureaucracy is nowhere to be seen., The public and media perception of the company is disappointing but to be expected. I've seen nothing but positive signs since joining and fully 100% stand behind the senior management and the strength of our new culture. You can tell management has taken on the task of fixing Uber's past problems very seriously., Keep doing everything you're doing.
﻿A great experience over 4 year at the company, A lot of possibilities and freedom to test new things especially if you work as a part of a county team, The company got more bureaucratic during the last few years which is a totally natural thing to happen when you switch from being a startup to a more established company, 
﻿Uber is a fantastic company despite what disgruntled drivers say., Beats Lyft any day. Busier by far. Uber Customers are superior to Lyft customers who I find to be 20 Something Airheads. Uber's driver interface and navigation are far superior to Lyft. If you need help Uber prefers that you call them on the phone. As opposed to Lyfts endless drop down menus and email nonsense that never solves your problem...etc. Btw I have 2500 rides with Lyft. I am FAR happier with Uber., None. Lyft has too many cons to count. Compared to uber Lyft is a joke and an insult to drivers., Charge the customers more. They will stay with you. Weed out the losers in the driver pool. Keep kicking butt. Keep innovating screw the naysayers.

﻿Meh. Quite disappointed actually., No real sense of direction. Managers only look out for themselves. Performance Review process is really unfair and one-sided. Salaries are much lower than market standard., Don't sell your people off like cattle., 
﻿Driver, Very flexible schedule( create your own) work where you want.. "Be your own boss", Sometimes takes long hours ques at airport possess mafia mentality certain areas possess a very dangerous clientelle, None because they do what they want...

﻿Great to work with, diversity at work... and acceptance... felt at home from the get go.., haven't encountered one yet.., 
﻿Freelance Driver, Flexible working hours you run it as your own business., Takings from driving still need to consider various related operating costs., Absorb the cost of drivers having to register with Taxi association.
﻿Marketing Intern (HK), , , 
﻿Uber review, Unexpected stories from riders. Potential for great conversation. If you like urban driving then this is very ideal., Pay for your own gas. You could only have a ride every or hour or so when there is no surge which leads to wasted gas and time., Keep innovating the platform.
﻿CARE ABOUT $ NOT EMPLOYEES, my schedule is up to me, have to work when everyone is working,

﻿Operations and Logistics Manager, Great compensations and benefits. I get to work with the smartest people I have met we share a vision common values and objectives.

﻿Worse customer service ever!!, Flexible hours and you meet cool people, Horrible customer service. You sit on hold for 30-90 minuted to finally get someone who can't speak english and who you can barely understand who 9 times out of ten does not answer your question because they can't cant even comprehend what your question is. So you hang up frustrated that you wasted hours of your life with no resolution. Uber as a company does not seem to care about their drivers at all., Improve your customer service!!!!!!!! Treat your drivers like they are an important part of your company.
﻿No, I can't think of anything positive to say about this place, Everything. The management and the owner all need to be replaced, Fire them all
﻿Uber Expert, Innovative Company Great Pay Rate Opportunities for Advancement Fantastic Offices Decent Hours and Schedules, As a Part Time Employee you don’t get as many benefits as a full-time employee such as Uber Credits. Also small offices generally don’t leave a lot of room for advancement unless you’re willing to relocate., More Benefits for Part Time Employees
﻿Not a good place to stay long, - challenging work high ownership of projects - change is the only constant exciting and steep learning curve, - arrogant managers and staff expect you to perform extraordinary or else you will be stuck in the same position for a long time (while pay and title not extraordinary) - not inclusive of colleagues with different personalities especially introverts - a bit of a 'clan' - you gotta show you are passionate to work everyday - doesn't treasure talent nor appreciate your effort, - be more inclusive of different people - recruit better staff in general stop being arrogant

﻿Good pocket money, Work when you want daily pay, Not a lot of money, Over half of pay goes towards gas. Mobile app has no way to contact customers until an order is marked as picked up (if there’s a problem with the order we shouldn’t have to mark is as being picked up just to call the customer and let them know there’s a problem).
﻿Uber driver, Make some serious $$ on certain days, Most days you'll be just driving around for hours with no rides since uber has been hiring everyone. I would recommend doing it as a side hustle but you can't fully depend on it, Since gas prices went up i thing it's fair for us at least to bring up the fare prices too

﻿The best company I've ever worked for!, Uber offers ahmaaaaazing benefits to employees. On top of that my work is personally fulfilling. I am given autonomy and creative authority over my work. I enjoy the culture here that celebrates differences and encourages you to shine by sharing ideas even if they start off utterly ridiculous or seem out of reach. I work alongside some of the most brilliant people you'll ever meet. What a treat! I have a voice..., The only con for me is the perception of the company in light of all the news articles that may paint Uber in a bad light. Our new CEO Dara has implemented many positive changes and under this leadership we will continue to grow improve and thrive!, Keep on doing what you're doing. Keep offereing wonderful programs to help us in our career development and that also benefit us in our personal lives. My work environment is a fair and safe space. I wake up excited about coming to work each and everyday. Thank you!

﻿Uber Driver, Flexibility in schedule you can set your own schedule., Not worth the wear and tear on your vehicle., Money needs to be increased to drivers when there are market changes such a gas price increase.
﻿Great place to grow and make an impact, I've worked for a number of great companies over the years: Google the games industry research labs. I can with confidence that Uber is the best place I've ever worked. The challenges are fascinating. We're not just building a website or driving ad clicks. We're attempting to fundamentally change the way people and things are transported around the globe. The impact is tangible. At a place like Google it's..., On the con side of the tech debt problem I alluded to before there are parts of the engineering process that are painful at times. We've been committing resources to fix it but there's still a lot of room to improve. Different parts of the organization still feel oceans apart. Maps reminds me a lot of Google other parts of the company feel like other organizations entirely. We still have a ways to go towards..., Keep focusing on the long term. Uber a platform is the future of the company. Growth at all costs was not the right approach. We need to focus on brining the best tech to the market with the right investments in the right industries (Eats and Freight are two great bets). Once we have world class tech build by world class talent the growth will naturally follow from there.
﻿Driver, Great flexibility and has been great pay., Not many incentives as compared to Lyft,

﻿Uber x driver, Choose when to work Pays decent when surging Good perks, Rates per mile is too low Bad customers from time to time, Higher the rates.
﻿Dynamic, Company has been making a lot effort in terms of employee management. Salary and Benefits have been improved over the last 1year, Management still not transparent. No manager training being performed. HR function too weak. More effort needed for employees to feel valued., 
﻿Uber SUCKS!!!, None except set your own hours, Too much BS and not enough benefit. Wear and tear on your vehicle and too many THREATS over the most trivial of things. Some riders love to lie and they will rat you out over anything - naturally Uber sides with its riders. You lose money when having to transport groups of 3 or more in one trip. The pay we get is disgusting., Read and understand EVERYTHING written in the Cons. Your company and your attitude towards your drivers needs to change and change NOW!!!
﻿Poor Effort, set your own hours to drive, No respect No help Bad pay, get a better team in place. Help out your drivers better
﻿Marketing Manager, People are smart work is meaningful, Uncertain due to all the mergers and employees are feeling worried, 
﻿Decent money only within small parameters., May be able to provide a decent side income if you work within a slim set of parameters that maximize income such as only working on weekends during the most busy times for bars., Terrible response time with issues relating to issues with passengers or income. Fully automated with little chance to interact with humans until you reiterate issue several times. Company consistently raises prices for passengers without increasing compensation to driver. Little opportunity to get profit outside of narrow time-frame of Friday-Saturday nights., 
﻿negative experience, no posibillity for promotion no learning experience, care more to contractor employee promote more inclusion within company, 
﻿I've worked at uber for 9 months, Great atmosphere recommended to work as a CSR  career path at Uber if you want to work in a field of customer service, bad management  there is no clear path for the promotion, 
﻿Dysfunctional team structure and incompetent managers., No feedback structure limited career advancement support. Dysfunctional managers and teams. No recourse or support for individuals impacted by poor processes., Train your managers and give them the skills and tools to effectively support their teams. Put systems in place to protect employees against incompetent managers., 
﻿Super Busy Super Productive Super Motivating, - Super Busy Super Productive Super Motivating - You can actually change life of people not just add a filter to a selfie. - Proud of working for a company with big bold bets, - Not the company fault but some employees haven't understood that this is still a company and they abuse it like IBM or something - They are evolving which is not wrong but just painful to people who don't like change., Hire little more motivated people
﻿poor incentives, drive when you want no boss, no incentives low pay uber does not care about delivery partners, listen to drivers
﻿Such a nice place, Imagine yourself working surrounded by high level professionals where anyone can give and idea and change things on a short period. We do work a lot but it is a really nice job!, There could be more work/balance and sometimes we change the strategy too fast so it is necessary a lot of flexibility from the employees to adapt.,

﻿It is good in a pinch but not sustainable, independent make your own schedule can make decent tips, it puts wear and tear to your car, pay needs to be increased or a baseline needs to be paid when online
﻿A company with no moral compass, - compensation - challenging problems - Uber and UberEats credits every month, - fake cultural values - no ethics - constant backbiting - toxic work culture - extremely pushy managers who will turn against you for small things and if you provide low rating / suggestions for improvement (and they will know who it is - your feedback is confidential but not anonymous). They are convinced that their system is the best., 
﻿Uber Eats Suck, Flexible Hours and if you like to Abuse your car then that one of the Pros, Pay Sucks  makes you run 2-5 miles to pay you $3 after taking a big chunk from your pa y  No tips  even the Restaurants treat you like Poop, Pay your Delivery Drivers so they want to work  you are eating Pies from all Sides
﻿Fast-paced lots of respect around, Good energy and ambiance; Focus on results not methods; True push for "doing the right thing", Most employees are much more competitive than collaborative (at least in Brazil where I work) Most leaders are still white males People outside the company don't see it as cool as it really is, To the Brazil office: Foster collaboration and actively reprimand those who work solely for their own departments or out of their own ego
﻿Good, - New CEO is a beast - Great mission - Interesting work - Smart people - Good working environment - Solid comp package, - Some inexperienced middle management - Many many layers of middle management, - Pay more attention to "less is more" mantra. - Do less do it better and do it faster.

﻿I'd possible add stars if this business would actually pay attention to the mistakes made towards my driver account, I'd like to share some but honestly haven't been able to get past the ghastly charges uber added to my driver account and has yet to remove and therefore have nothing positive to say just yet., I live in a city where on the Uber website it specifically states there is no inspection fee however I was charged $20 before even starting with this company for exactly that reason. I've now called 5 times and spoken with several individuals who all say I will be credited anywhere from 24 to 72 hours from the time of the call. It has now been 2 weeks since my initial calls and I have yet to see the credit. Stupidly..., Give your over the phone agents the ability to rectify said issues without emailing support staff who never follow up.
﻿Software Engineer I, *Really smart and talented coworkers. I feel like I learn a lot from working with my teammates and learn about a lot of new technologies. *Fast paced and never a deficit of work to be done. The company moves quickly and the energy in the workplace is really high. *It's motivating to work for a company whose product I use so frequently. The product itself is known around the world and I enjoy using it in my personal..., *It feels like a lot of teams do similar work and it can sometimes feel really competitive between teams within Uber which is kind of disappointing. *The negative media attention that Uber gets can be difficult to deal with. It can make you feel embarrassed at times to tell people where you work when the company itself has such a negative reputation to build up from., 
﻿Customer support representative, - Give a chance to everybody to work there - Nice environment and perks, - Shifts (8am-7pm / 9am-9pm / 1pm-00am) - The possibility to evolve on a responsability position (really few places for hundreds of people) - The processes to apply on a specific position change a lot from a time to another as if managers know who they want and want to adapt the process to match with the person they want rather than to give the chance to everybody, Do not make the talented and motivated people live
﻿Great flexibility, Work any time you want. Very busy in the Seattle area almost 24 hours a day. Friendly people almost no issues witch customers even at 2am on a Saturday night., Lots of wear and tear on your car., 
﻿Uber eats, None. If you can actually get this to work it would be a miracle. I have never had a positive experience with uber eats., Shut it down. Worst experience I’ve had with a company. If your order even gets processed at all they’ll either cancel it or it will take 4 hours., Take away the very over priced “booking fee” when very simple orders get cancelled or take a ridiculous amount of time. This is why your drivers don’t get tipped.
﻿Uber Eats Driver, - Work when you want (for the most part) - Work where you want - Hourly average is not bad. My area (Las Vegas) provides times where they pay more (1.2 - 1.6X more called Boosts) I only work during those times. I've been delivering for about a month now about 80 deliveries. I'm making on average $13 per hour including tips working only during Boost times. - Having he Boost times - No one to manage you and..., - Have to be careful and not accept deliveries that are too far away. As a rule I don't accept deliveries that are 10 or minutes away from where I am. I am not paid anything for the 10 minute+ drive to get to the pick-up location so it tends not to be worth it. You have to be smart about it and stay stationed in an area with a lot of restaurants to your pick-up drive is not far. - 50-75% of each delivery the restaurant..., - Keep up the Boost promotions. This make it worthwhile otherwise I'm not making enough money. - Encourage resturants who make drivers wait (because of their inefficiencies) to somehow make it up to the drivers by giving them coupons for free meals freebies something to drink while they are waiting coupons for future visits. This is a super frustrating part of the job especially when it is long and the restuarant...
﻿Good company to work for, , , 
﻿Harassment, They are almost comparable to lyft, They will keep logging you out of your driver account when they want to harass you and claim it’s for security purposes, It’s not necessary to log a driver out of his account three times within 24 hours unless your intentions are to harass someone- which I honestly believe is the case

﻿Driver Operations Specialist, Toxic work environment No work/life balance, You can't lose billions of other people's money indefinitely, 
﻿Business Analyst, Uber is an awesome place for learning, Not I can think of as of now, 
﻿Great experience & people bad HR, Brilliant minds work for Uber and working with those people is fantastic. You are never the smartest person in the room people are eager to help and share know-how. The learning curve for every Uber employee is very sharp., Uber HR still has a lot to learn and improve. The communication received by employees is full of PR but nothing of substance. Uber does not actually care about its employees the ones that have been building markets from scratch and massively fires them once they did so without trying to find other opportunities within the company. Compensation is really bad and if you get promoted you might end up with a 3% raise..., Do the right thing not only for riders drivers and delivery partners but also for the people!
﻿Account Representative : Uber Eats, Ride credits and free lunch, This company is a mess. They treat sales people like a call center. The sales people are viewed as scum here. The sales org is basically run by operations and they have no idea how to manage a sales org. They set out of this world goals that are impossible to meet thus creating a toxic and misserable place to work. Also everyone is so ultra sensitive. I feel like I am walking on eggshells all the time. There are..., Stand up for yourself. Do what's right. Pay your employees fairly. Make it more fun.
﻿Great place, Good pay Many perks Systematic approach Respect for time, Formal work environment Employees to worried to let their guard down, Need to create an environment where people can laugh and relax on a day to day basis. Too high strung for such a cool organisation right now.

﻿Wanted it to be great but it's not ..., Start and stop when you want. Work as little or as much as you want., Pay has been decreasing. They offer incentives but practically call you a criminal so that they don't have to pay them out., You offered me $100 to complete 60 trips on the last week I worked for you. I completed 67.

﻿Expert In-Person Greenlight Hub, Meeting people from all over the world and helping them is an amazing opportunity. Being the only point of contact that is in-person often means you are also the "last line of defense" which means you are an alternative way to make the Drivers in your community feel better in ways that might have frustrated them until they meet with you., The training process is not where it should be and nearly everyone seems to have a bumpy ride on their way to getting the hang of things which can be daunting. Also because you are often the third point of contact for Drivers...many people need to be shown a lot of empathy and understanding along with being told "bad" news from yet another source. This can make for somewhat uncomfortable and emotional moments for all..., It would be AMAZING if the training process involved "dummy" accounts rather than knowing every move you make has direct and immediate consequences. It would be nice to not have to jump in the deep end at every turn as you learn here. :)
﻿Drive, Flexible hours and fun job, Not the best hourly wages., 
﻿Enginering Manager, Working with top talent colleagues, Late working hours is needed, Keep up the good work
﻿General Manager, Uber has outstanding learning and growth opportunities. Employees are fully empowered to challenge the status quo and build an amazing business from the ground up. Has a great culture with young and talented people that will challenge you to become better everyday., Uber fully empowers their employees to take vacations and time to recharge but work can get pretty intense., 
﻿Regional Operations Manager LatAm, Challenging and Supporting culture that makes you excel in your professional careers. Many benefits and easy to switch among different roles, Demanding tasks and learning on the job., 
﻿Pay attention to your pay. They're thieves., Lots of fares. Will have you thinking the money paid is fair., Inconsistent pay. No human contact. Robbery. Exploitation of drivers and customers., Give up before you're sued for every penny you've earned for stealing.
﻿If you are willing to get your hands dirty and make a huge impact this is the right place for you!, I could list the pros all day but here is a select few: - awesome team: 95%+ of the people I work with at Uber are amazing and people who I consider friends not just colleagues - you can be yourself: want to wear shorts and thongs to work? this is the place for you! In my experience you can be your authentic self (whatever that may be!) - treated really well: despite what you might read in the press Uber is..., - it's a bloody lot of work: if you love to take things on cruise control this is not the place for you. It's definitely not a 9-5 type environment (and I hope it never becomes that!) - public scrutiny: you need to be thick skinned as not everyone will love Uber as much as you might. Whether it's an unhappy driver partner that you need to win back over or a know it all relative at Christmas lunch you will find yourself..., The Uber I know is incredible and a lot of the early Sr Managers are to thank for that. Naturally the company has to mature and has a huge responsibility at the size it is now however I don't want Uber to turn into another big boring corporate. Let's keep the founding spirit alive and push through the challenges whilst also being better corporate citizens - to our customers (most importantly drivers) and the communities...
﻿I do not recommend., Culture is geared towards drinking and there is so much tension between the sexes. News articles you read are true--it's a frat boy playground where white guys in hoodies rule. Women have less opportunity to advance because they are often told that they are "not a good fit.", The workplace shouldn't feel a high school clique. Employees who work hard should be rewarded--not the ones who drink hard., 
﻿Nice additional source of income, Nice additional source of income, Pick up a lot of drunks and people getting sick., More savings/discounts for drivers.

﻿My work at Uber, What I love about Uber is that there is a spot for everyone. There is a wide range of job of opportunities and within a certain role you can always speak your mind and try out new things. It is my first job and I am so excited about it because here they have taught me incredible things about working in teams sharing initiatives with other countries and traveling to meet new people like A LOT. Your mind opens in ways..., Well cons.. I think it has more to do with the past of Uber as a company. It used to be a company with a really bad brand image and is always in headlines for making really big mistakes. But today I can say that my last six months we've been working so hard to make things better for our customers and we will be the company everyone used to love, 
﻿Uber needs to pay more, Meeting people making your own schedule & instant pay., Uber does not always pay enough. Gas wear & tear on your vehicle., All rides should be a minimum charge of $8.00-$10.00. Our cars have to have maintenance. Breaks tires & more oil changes than normal plus gas. Take care of your employees & higher your standards. By doing so it will motivate excellent service from the employees & drive out the competition.
﻿Would not recommend, Driving around and meeting new people, People are the worst no respect, Pay drivers
﻿Great place to work maybe the best I have ever worked., -Great Flexibility -A lot of independence -Tons of responsibility -The company values difference -You can be yourself -It's a company of best ideas -Flexible dress code, -Pay is below average for big companies -Politics sometimes get in the way (although a lot less than other companies I have worked for), Make sure not to lose everything that brought us so far.
﻿Very pumped and satisfied with the challenges, - Amazing challenges: company still have A LOT of room for growth and development of cool stuff - Quality and caliber of coworkers - Culture - very cooperative and inclusive, - Some processes are not as well defined as mature companies. But the company is working hard to close the gaps soon, 
﻿Uber Driver, Work when wanted no Boss, Car wear and tear Passenger damaging car passenger anger and attitude problems, The Uber Management team is great with all issues that happen and able solve them quick but some passengers need calm down with there attitude and let us do our job not get mad at us for doing it there way to make them happy (part of the job )
﻿So far so good, Great responsibilities great working culture benefits, Company has become too big, 
﻿costly positive experience, flexibility; meeting and helping people; unique opportunity to learn and enjoy the city., high fuel and maintenance costs, increase rates
﻿Amazing place to work!, Career growth benefits flexibility and challenges. The work culture help you to learn a lot and to encourage you to develop your skills and personal objectives., No cons at all just the best place to work I had experienced so far. Definitely has none cons I had identified., 
﻿LatAm Sr. Regional Ops Manager, . Working with super talented people . Team bonding activities . Ability to change roles within the region or to other regions, . Long working hours (but as everyone feels so passionate about our mission this is not a big deal), 
﻿Driver Indianapolis, Pick your own schedule easy work, Some riders are a lot to deal with, Continue to take driver input into account when updating policies and apps
﻿Have never been happier professionally, Excellent culture environment and focus on people, Workload is large business never stops, Continue listening to people and acting accordingly. Proud of the steps taken so far.
﻿Passionate people solving the hardest problems, Uber gives you the opportunity to work with the brightest minds around and allows you to get hands-on on solving the problems that impact the way our cities and communities are built., The company is getting too big. More people = more bureaucracy = slower innovation., 
﻿CRM Technology Manager, We have visibility of all the work other teams are doing and also for us is super clear how our work is making impact in the region., We are a new team we are in process to centralize so it's a lot of funny work., 
﻿Growth Marketing Manager, Flexible culture good learning curve, Rapid changes which can be very disruptive, 
﻿my summer internship at uber, , , 
﻿High Performing pace and super solid team, First Uber still have some trait of start ups: city teams have independence to propose ideas to their own city you have access to all the information you need (with a very hard privacy policy) and people are always looking for improvements. Second before joining Uber I heard many bad aspects of the culture in place but things has change dramatically since mid 2017. Now there is a super bright and high performing team..., Given that Uber has more than doble month by month for a long period there are some internal process that needs to be fixed., 
﻿Best place to work ever, You will work with smart and nice team players and you will feel challenged with problems to be solved every day. The compensation is super competitive and it goes beyond cash. At Uber you will definitely feel that you are an owner of Uber because you actually will be. Tons of opportunities to grow and if you are a rockstar you will be promoted quickly or moved to other countries if you want. This is the most aligned..., Very few processes since it is a startup but it gives you a lot of flexibility to explore and experiment by yourself., We are growing super fast and so far the environment and the compensation is really nice so I advice to keep doing it to attract top talent.
﻿Enjoyed my time despite company being in turmoil, Benefits (health insurance unlimited PTO office lunches) and positive hard working co-workers were awesome., Lack of career pathing. Everything cool that goes on at Uber takes place in SF so regional offices get overlooked., 
﻿Incredible place to drive real world impact, At Uber you have an amazing opportunity to have substancial real world impact through technology that drives self-employment business empowerment for restaurants and actually provide time back to people who use our platforms., Work is intense and ever changing the speed is quick and there is a very strong bias for execution., Ensure we continue to keep bar high on hiring and adapting to changing market needs.
﻿Uber in Latin America is a great place to be, I have worked at Uber for 3 years two years in the US and one year in Latin America. Working for Uber in Latin America is an amazing experience to grow professionally and personally. Some pros: - Fast-paced environment with a ton of ownership - Ability to make an impact from day 1 - Energized teams and talented coworkers that make me excited to come to work every day - Career opportunities and professional development..., The company is actively improving work/life balance and compensation but these are two areas could be cons: - Work/life balance can be a struggle at times due to the fast-paced work environment - The company is still working to make compensation competitive to the market, 
﻿You'll learn many new skills and much more about yourself at Uber, - Autonomous - Get to work on problems that are moving the dial - we're aiming for 10% improvements not 0.1% improvements - Highly motivated peers that drive you to be your best - High pressure workplace that allows you to better understand yourself and what drives you, - Still figuring out HR: trying to implement big company policies with the impact of coming down as an iron curtain sometimes - Pay is considered too low and the 'excitement of your role' is treated as a financial benefit - As a relatively young company with a very flat organizational structure people considering working for Uber should be comfortable knowing they'll need to carve out their own career path, 
﻿Great place to work, I feel like there is fairness when it comes to career opportunities. I'm impressed by the number of people that I've seen growing in less than 2 years time. Also I love the fact that everybody is very involved while being autonomous at work. Empowerement is great at Uber and was never seen before anywhere else., High level of stress / pressure to deliver results. Although there are many (good) intentions and processes to reduce it business always ends being the most important piece and work/life balance is not in fact always as great as we believe it is / as HR wants it to be., 
﻿One of the best challenges you can pick, Uber is a place where you can truly be yourself you have the freedom to explore excel at your job and you work with the best and smartest people around you., As one of the fastest growing companies in the world Uber has no schedules and the pressure to excel at your job can be a little overwhelming at times., 
﻿The most exiting ride, - Huge impact on direct customers and cities - Freedom of innovation and decision making - Exponential growth - Uber perks, - Onboarding could have been much better - Work-life balance, 
﻿Best team ever, - good autonomy at work; you plan your own work provided you can show results - good team spirit - free lunches to build team morale by eating together - people are professional and cooperate together to make something work - good benefits including leave medical insurance etc, - lots of process gaps - may need to hustle at times need to resolve a crisis ASAP sometimes - changes are sometimes implemented from the HQ without advance notice to the regional offices - depending on your own values you may not like the startup culture, Please pre-empt regional teams before you implement a major change to a process.
﻿Retail Operations Supervisor, is a company that allows you to grow professionally and personally the support of the entire team at a global level is incredible! Once inside you can not stop thinking about how you can help your team your company move your city!, We are a practically new company full of innovations and some areas of opportunity but undoubtedly a team united for the same purpose, 
﻿Waste of time, Flexible work hours but that's it. Flexible hours but no money, Pays at less than minimum wage on an average. Not really sure how others are pulling it off but a slight sense of mathematics will tell you that its time to quit, Uber 24x7 support is useless and they seem to be outsourced to another country. No one understands English properly and they have no idea of what's going on for the most part.
﻿A place for talents obsessed with working in pursuit of purpose and impact, Ownership: Uber is a place where you are always expected to deliver on vision execution and iterative innovation - and you're expected to be driven by the inner fire that is purpose. Impact: Your decisions drive the business and the business touches millions of people every single day in very real very tangible ways. This is a unique motivator for anyone who cannot stomach work as "filling a chair" and craves responsibility, Work is potentially 24/7. Anyone who is happy and fulfilled at Uber has in her/him an inner self-propulsor and he/she is comfortable with accepting as a tradeoff that less time is left for personal life., Hire a world-class head of product and fix the process and culture of innovation that was essential to formidable early success and will be indispensable for future growth. Strengthen aggressively our Data Science capabilities and drive segmentation relentlessly. Resist overcompensating for too long versus Uber-under-Travis. While segments of the company's culture were broken then - many values and many talents absorbed...
﻿DON'T DO IT!! THEY ARE THIEVES!!, Can be good money. Could be even better if Uber paid you honestly. No specific hours to work it's whenever you want. Paid daily if you want for a $0.50 fee each time and the money appears in your bank within 15 seconds., THEY ARE THIEVES!! They ended up stealing from me by not paying me for trips and cancellations or paying me less than what I should have been paid.

﻿Great for self-employment, Lucrative if you're in a city with a lot of highways and no traffic. You can meet a lot of cool people from all walks of life., Wear and tear on your vehicle.

﻿Very Good experience, networking too many opportunities to growth within the company, in some countries in LATAM we are not regulated so is is not so easy to work, 
﻿The most exciting job I been in the last years, I so excited about what we are doing at Uber really having the opportunity to design the strategy of the fastest moving company of all times and then being in charge of implement it. All this with extremely talented folks and the greatest work environment., The fast pace and passion cause us to focus on too many things rather than fewer more impactful ones., 
﻿Great place to work at, - brilliant colleagues - great benefits, - tough work life balance - demoralised team, 
﻿Impactful work great culture fantastic colleagues, You work with motivated smart and fun people on a daily basis which leads to one of the best cultures at Uber The leaders of the LatAm org are incredible and focus on building fellow leaders The work matters and you're given the chance to have an impact from Day 1 The cafeteria serves a great breakfast and lunch as well as a coffee bar all day Everyone including junior team members are given the freedom to..., There's a lot of work to be done which sometimes can mean long hours.

﻿Amazing Company to work for, Fast paced environment that is constantly growing and innovating brilliant people working in all teams great same cultural fit within coworkers making it easy to make friends and find things in common flexible work environment empowerment to actually propose things and very inclusive, Constant change so while its a good thing you must be very adaptable, 
﻿Overall is good., Good workplace culture. Everyone's so smart and there is always room for you to contribute and grow in the team., The payment wasnt that good for my homebased work office. Also there is still lot of unstability in the office., -
﻿Dynamic and inclusive, Uber is a dynamic company that not only allows you to develop different skills & knowledge but also has an amazing and inclusive culture that makes working there every day a joy., Although the culture values and diversity are amazing very few employees do not share the vision and are not that "open"., Keep doing what you are doing

You'll be much more passionate in the projects you lead in Uber than having..., - Work/life balance: you will work a lot. Most of Uber employees are hard working and are not forced to stay at the office ( at the contrary management will push you to respect your work life balance) but you will definitely work a lot. - Salary/Benefits if you compare to other sectors where you could probably be working (bank/M&A/consultant) and paid much more. - Vertical moves and promotions might be difficult..., 
﻿Doesnt pay after every ride, You're able to make extra money, You don't get paid for every ride and when you catch the mistake they made you wait 48 hours and if you don't cash out when they feel you need to you won't get paid until they feel like paying you, You need to have a phone number where you can talk to a human being and not have to keep emailing the computer it doesn't make sense that it takes so long to get a response back from a company is very unprofessional
﻿Shame on Uber!, Instant money on card. Meet new people, Never get any bonuses. No substantial way to make more income or supplement what I LOST on a trip! Tipping atleast 15% would change ALOT! you take 30% and dont pay our taxes? Someone orders a crap ton of food and then i have to drive it across town 13 miles and only get paid for the drive there then back comes outta my pocket and there are hardly any incentives to work for you. My cars accruing damage and all you pay..., Please add more incentives to work for you. You NEED to. Please add more money for faster delivery or pay us for wait time at a restaurant. Find a way to pay people who have done more order better. Something! Surges are a lie in my whole city.
﻿Uber Partner Driver, - Work on own schedule - Make extra disposable income, - Lack of driver support - Difficult to communicate issues, - Improve the Driver Partner application to fit on iPhone X screen - Improve driver customer service
﻿Uber as a startup/multinational tech company, The culture is really great--very flexible and people-oriented. It's kind of how Google treats their employees., Career progressions are still being developed. For entry-level analysts it's kind of hard to grasp where you'll be in the next few years. Also work can be demanding most of the times--a typical set-up for a tech company, Make career progressions clearer and more defined for employees.
﻿Great Company, Make your own dollar when you want., A lot of driving on your car., 
﻿Amazing place to accelerate your learning have big impact and open up a world of opportunities, -The amount of responsibility you're entrusted with from very early on is refreshing and empowering -Significant opportunity more than almost any company I've seen to change direction in your career try something new try a new location anywhere in the world, -Only just starting to build out official training/development programs although making great progress -Benefits in non-US locations aren't stellar, 
﻿General Manager, Exciting job great culture challenging and impactful work, Lack of a more formal structure due to rapid growth, 
﻿Company Culture, They love to hire young people because they see them as the future. Great benefits. Offers breakfast and catered lunch and snacks., Hard to be promoted at f you start as a level one employee. If you start out doing something they don’t like it will haunt you for your entire career even if you’ve stopped a long time ago., Pay attention to ppl the hustle experience. Stop picking favorites or puppets.
﻿Uber Eats Driver, - Work whenever you want. - Near constant orders around lunch or dinner near restaurant clusters. - ~$11/hr after gas + vehicle expenses (in my 3 month experience). - Discounts and referral bonuses., Uber navigation app takes you to neighboring addresses the back of a community (exit only) and switching to Google Maps takes a minor effort on top of handling food and driving. You need to learn which areas are good which orders lead to worse areas and should consider carrying pepper spray if in a bad area., Let drivers offer unsolicited ideas on improving the app in a way that doesn't automatically claim their intellectual property please.
﻿Life at Uber!, Excellent environment and friendly behaviour from the colleagues., Needs to deal with drivers and partner people are often rude and arrogant. Managing them is a big hectic job., Needs to support the employees more and appreciate them for their good works.
﻿Great learning opportunity, High degree of ownership and responsibility steep learning curve fun and smart colleagues, Getting more bureaucratic as it grows, 
﻿Uber Partner Driver, , , 
﻿Best place to work!, At Uber I get to work every day with people incredibly talented and passionate about what they do. There is a profound drive for the mission at hand that get's you going even for long hours but without ever feeling bored or having any regrets. We move faster in a month than most of the previous companies I worked for do in a whole year!, This is not a 9 to 5 place. If you are looking for that type of job Uber is not the place for you. In addition career planning is still a WIP an whether opportunities open each day for those looking for more certainty and structure about their growth it could be challenging, 
﻿Great Company with Great Work Culture, Good working culture great people and the ability to grow. Lunch provided., There's gap between full time employees and contract workers., 
﻿-, Excellent place to work. Top talent and some of the world's most advanced and exciting challenges., Not a place for people who love big bureaucratic companies., 
﻿Amazing experience / Great career development, I'm working in Uber Eats and as most of Uber roles it has a challenging environment meaning that I'm learning a lot every single day. People is supportive and specially in LATAM we work as a team. We enjoy lunch together and have activities outtside work too :) Environment is relaxed. It doesn't matter how you dress (we are keen about diversity) but it is more focused on you and your goals., There is a gap in Equity and benefits between old school and new employees but HR is trying to work on that., Keep managing the cultural change like you are doing.
﻿Great place to work, Great caliber of team members and insipiring leads. Providing a great strategy that will pay off long term. Actively working to improve trouble areas and focus on improving strategy and planning., As with every growing tech company too much to do not enought ime., Stay the course current strategy is going to payoff long term even though there may some short term pain.
﻿Great company, , , 
﻿Best place for milennials, Work flexibility on schedules and home office free on-site food high responsibility shared team spirit, Competitive environment suitable for top performers but not great for more collaborative mindsets; management sees individual development as a box to check not as a core management practice, Growth opportunities abound we need to showcase them more
﻿Driver, It is very flexible which is good., Constant driving is annnoying and can be hard at times., better quality
﻿Best work experience so far! (+10 years of total work experience), Bring innovation to our cities and flexible income opportunities / Work with extremely talented co-workers / Data rich environment / Shape the future of mobility (of people and other things), Center of media attention is not always positive (and many times completely unfair) / Governments are not always open to innovative companies such as ours, 
﻿Lots of hustle challenges and learnings in the fastest growing markets in the Uberverse, -Be part of a team that is changing our cities and making them better -Autonomy to make a big impact and learn from your mistakes -Amazing coworkers that inspire you to do bigger and better things everyday, -Could be a challenging environment for people who are uncomfortable with uncertainty and like very direct management -Growing pains from becoming a very large team very quickly. Uber is catching up on HR and learning and development industry practices, 
﻿The best professional challenge, You can build from scratch and have a global impact in time record. You own your growth and have the unique opportunity to collaborate with great people!., Sometimes the fast paced growth can be challenging., 
﻿Uber Partner, I do appreciate the fact that I am able to create my own schedule and drive on my terms. As a stand-up comedian it is necessary for me to have some flexibility., I feel unsafe at times especially when driving at night and being a female. The responses from Uber have not been quick enough most times., I think that the help from Uber needs to be more personal as people have gone through serious situations while driving and we require empathy and attentive customer service interactions.
﻿Senior Operations and Logistics Manager, -Very flexible work schedule -Full ownership of your projects -Great positive and engaging culture, -Low pay versus tech competitors -Not as strong leadership -Priorities change frequently, Make sure to have strong career paths for your talented teams!

﻿fair, good paid and free. earn good money, $1000 deductible on car insurance, 
﻿driver, Flexible hours good customer service, Long hour treat employees with respect, treat your employees with respect
﻿Best place for those who get bored at Google, - Company is growing at an incredible rate - Much higher rate of personal career growth possible than at Google or Facebook - Business directly touches the physical world instead of making money through ads - High impact projects - Hybrid between a startup and large company - Monthly Uber credits and free rides home from work late at night, - Company currently caught in a negative press cycle that seems to feed itself - Offices not as nice as Google or Facebook (At least until the new HQ is built) - Work hours in the 50-60 hours week range instead of the 30-35 hours week range at Google / Facebook, - Don't become a boring company keep the startup spirit a part of Uber's core - If Uber becomes another big company bloated with bureaucracy like Microsoft/IBM/Google/Apple a lot of people will start leaving
﻿Exciting/challenging work. Bad culture., Lots of exciting problems to work on and solve. Most roles are given a lot of autonomy. Uber (and therefore your work) is very visible., There is a serious leadership void – extremely few good leaders. Most managers/leaders are self-serving. You are expected to be always-on. The culture is still very toxic., There's still too much holdover from the days of TK. The culture and many processes are still very bad. People are leaving in droves.
﻿My review of Uber, Great company to work for on your own time surge is great when it's great you get tips now and populated areas are always busy, Not as many benefits as Lyft implies the cost per mile in which drivers are paid keep going down some rides are not even worth $5, Keep costs around $1.00 $1.50 per mile and I guarantee you people will still pay for it and you will keep many drivers happier and wealthier
﻿Community Internship, I had a great time during my internship. I had a lot of freedom to work on several projects at the same time. Everyone was really eager to share their knowledge with me. I got to learn from people in a lot of different departments and work on high-impact projects. Office space is also really cool and the people are impressive., Due to the scattered and fast-paced nature of their company there were a lot of times I had to change gears super suddenly or wait on someone way higher up to give me the go ahead. Also for an intern with not a ton of clearance there are only so many platforms and information you can access. That sort of limited my experience. I also think that they need to reprioritize some things to be a more stable environment...., Slow down and use strategy that really means something instead of some appealing buzzwords.
﻿Over exploiting Interns, free snacks everyday. young people around and passionate., Over exploiting Interns. Late hours often., 
﻿Overall I'm happy working for UberEATS, Flexible. No middle management to answer to. Good rate if you work fast and efficiently. Communicate well through emails to drivers and riders. Increasing business coming online. Local Greenlight Hub., Awful support. Unable to deliver during bad weather. App sometimes has issues., Improve the quality of your worker support. Bad experiences every time. Regularly misunderstood and responses don't match questions or concerns.

﻿One of the best places in Europe for hardcore software engineering, Teams are small and insanely impactful. Engineers deploy code to systems with >10K QPS daily run experiments on hundreds of thousands or millions of users and work on projects with millions of dollars of impact or savings. We get to work (super) close with data science product and design and have a real say in decisions made. Colleagues are nice and friendly. Compensation is exceptionally good for Amsterdam..., As the office has grown some of the community feel is starting to disappear. Projects still have massive impact but we are starting to have a lot more people contribute to something that one person used to do (which is a good thing for quality & work life balance for sure)., Keep investing in Amsterdam. It is becoming truly one of the really great Uber offices.
﻿Make your own hours the pay could be better, Making your own hours direct deposit is available decent customer service and the navigation app is really good. There are also safety measures put in place when you are out on runs., The pay isn't that great and most customers don't tip. You are putting miles and wear and tear on your car and paying for gas for very minimal pay (I worked about 15 hours in a weekend and made about 160.00 total). Customer service doesn't seem very informed so maybe going and speaking to someone at a brick and mortar Uber shop would be your best bet but call ahead they will sometimes close the entire shop due to..., Look into adding gratuity or encourage people to tip a bit more. I understand that you are getting paid regardless but we are the ones out there working on our weekends or trying to support families. What we are providing is a service so at the very least customers should be encouraged if not required to tip the driver something.

﻿Uber Driver, The hours were flexible and there were a lot of benefits build into the agreement, I could never drive enough hours to make up the cost of the rental, I "rented" a car through Uber last summer to make some extra money and because I didn't have a car but needed one. The agreement standard agreement is that you can borrow the car from Uber if you make enough money to earn back the cost of the rental. I was able to work part time before work and on the weekends. I never had a problem with the passengers or the rental car company (Uber partners with Enterprise). Maintenance...
﻿Customer Care Representative, Free Lunch Free Snack Free benefits Great Culture, Young management Too many changes too soon, 
﻿Love it but...., Love being self-employed and only answering to myself. Work whenever I want to and no more., It's hard to find constant areas to patrol in to find the maximum number of rides. Not making as much money as is claimed by Uber. In fact far less., 
﻿Great company culture, Great company culture that really tried to promote team-work even across divisions and functions, very data-sensitive to interns difficult to work and deliver when a lot of the data was concealed, be more transparent!
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Uber Eats is Very Strange, You can make enough to buy some groceries, Uber Eats has no driver support. I worked for them for a year there were only a few problem customers. This year somebody changed the GPS app the map flips and freezes gives wrong locations. Got two serious customers in a row that gave wrong addresses to the restaurant then gave me a hard time when I tried to find them. I just don’t feel safe driving for them any longer. Some of thr customers are getting weird....,

﻿Driver, You drive when you want to drive., The company isn’t fair at all to its drivers. Drivers are called “partners” by UBER but yet treated like absolute crap. The company goes out of its way to generously please and appease its riders at the slightest complaint and sets the bar extraordinary high in resolving any issues file by drivers. I understand are the bread and butter for the company but drivers are the machinery that make things because without drivers..., Listen to both sides. Default position should not be skewed to benefit riders without first getting all the facts.
﻿Amazing growth opportunities not so great compensation and work/life balance, You work with some of the smartest people Transparency in communicating with leadership - they genuinely want to hear the good and the bad Your work affects hundreds of thousands of people Things move quickly (maybe too quickly) Everyone is genuinely #superpumped about Uber's future prospects Good equity compensation, Because you work with very smart people you also navigate a lot of huge egos Leadership makes shallow attempts at showing empathy and taking action on feedback - culture progress is slow You could be paid better for less technically rigorous work at other top tech firms. Bonuses are small and if you're salaried you're screwed because you'll work a lot more than 40 hours per week, Listen deeply act quickly (or at least tell us what next steps are) Be transparent about compensation (why are we paid this much? what is the rationale behind bonuses?)
﻿Driver, Hourly pay is between $17-25 after gas, Week day pay isn’t high, Better customer service response internally
﻿Recruiting Co-ordinator, This company has Great Environment and Good opportunities Something additionally good about this place is Salary and the Benefits they provide and the fresh culture they have., The con would be that since its startup the process and everything else is very unstable and highly volatile also there working patern and style and are defined and very messy all over., One small piece of advice is to Shift towards more organised as its growing everyday and it cannot always stay in this position.

﻿Good side money!, No schedules no boss it's on my schedule money can be good., App issues drivers are the least importance of the company. Ride fares keep getting lowered so you'll have to drive much longer to make decent money., The ride fares are an embarrassment.

Usually..., Most customers don't tip. Certain restaurants don't have their act together (i.e. McDonald's). Sometimes it can be frustrating and time-consuming trying to get into gated communities. Also finding apartment numbers (especially at night) can be challenging and sometimes customers don't even provide an apartment number so you have to call/text them to figure it out. Finally I have noticed that customers frequently..., Adjust the UberEats app so that the customer has to manually enter their address and apartment number because I believe the GPS tries to approximate their address and they may not realize that they provided the incorrect address.
﻿Under Driver / Uber Partner Review, Set your own schedule meet new people a chance to get out and see the local area, Requires long hours to earn a comfortable living. At different times I did this a part-time job and a full time job and it worked better (and I enjoyed it more) as a part-time job. The company is continually evolving its service offerings and payment/promotional offerings to drivers but it seems to slowly be squeezing drivers' pay and making it more difficult for us., Stop making it more and more difficult for drivers to earn a living wage.
﻿Driving Down, There is no schedule so you can work when and where you want., Use your car. The rates and compensation are so little it's disgusting. No compensation for "Deadhead" or going to pickup a passenger. In Philadelphia region wrestle with traffic and lights lucky to earn $15 per hour for you and your car.

﻿Great company to work for!, , , 
﻿Good job, The great thing about uber is that you can choose your own time schedule. Its absolutely your decision to work the hours you want for the income you want. Some people like me love the "more hours more money" system, The down side can be the repetitive kind of job it is. But more important is that your not really learning anything and worst not getting any better nor upgrading in the company with time., I would find the way to upgrade 5 star riders. Privileges increased rate bank agreements for minimum car loans and things like that.

It worked out for a year and a lot of people are nice to you., They don’t have police come and see if your sober or not. A hacker told them I was under the influence twice. Many people lied telling Uber I did things I didn’t do. Eventually that led to my firing. Even though I have inward and outward facing cameras in the car. Uber didn’t care about the evidence. They only believed the lies first without any fact checking at all., Have a Police Officer go out and check if the person is really under the influence or not. Allow the camera to decide as well.

That was nifty., Gas car depreciation car expenses paying taxes (independent contractor) and on top of all of it you have to give Uber 20% of your earnings.

﻿Recruiter LATAM, I have had the best time hiring awesome talent in the region. Learning a lot about customer experience tools and efficiency. Uber cares for his employees and I love being part of HR in a company that believes Recruitment is a priority that impacts the business., I have gone through several changes in processes because we are growing really fast and becoming a well-established company. This means hard work learning to adapt and cooperate with change management.

﻿Amazing Opportunity, Opportunities for growth able to make a big impact. Company really cares about getting better., Company grew too fast and couldn't keep up. Many of the policies you would expect for a company of this size simply don't exist. Leadership is trying to play catch up but it's hard., Keep showing how much you care!

﻿UBER partner - Full time Driver - Sydney Australia, Drive when and where you want own boss good income for experienced driver. Meet interesting people., drunk or aggressive passengers. Difference in driver benefits between cities. Long hours required to obtain satisfactory income., Be aware we are able to obtain up to date information designated to USA drivers in Australia which shows great inequality between overseas locations. Drivers are classified as partners however are treated as third rate by mannagement.

﻿On it's way to greatness, Amazing opportunity to work with great minds solving a multitude of problems in record time, The company is still developing itself and it's identity as it gets into different market and that requires structure.

﻿A Great Place to Revolutionize the World, Uber is standing up a world class team to help transportation in cities flow as easily as running water., I've heard Uber's snacks are not as good as others in the Valley but honestly if you're only concerned about snacks and not helping society you've got your priorities flipped., Dara and the new executive team are doing a fantastic job helping the company mature.

﻿Just Another Sleeze Ball Ride Share company, Work at Will. That is about it., Excessive wear and tear on vehicle. Uber is an extremely extremely difficult company to interact with Earn way under minimum wage Encounter many people who need to bathe Expenses to what Uber compensates way off balance definitely not a long term employment opportunity., Your 180 day period of making change was a total sham. Simply a PR stunt to try and clean your image. There was absolutely no sincere intention behind the action. Uber is and always will be an unscrupulous devious blood sucking company on the world wide landscape ....
﻿Ubereats is not worth it, Being able to be out and about with technically no boss Able to listen to music and smoke whenever you want, Pay is not worth it I make minimum wage when I put so much miles on my car there's no tips that come in I've done 500 the liveries and only have gotten 40 tips at most I've also put about 5000 miles on my car and like I said before after cost of gas I make around minimum wage not including oil changes Tire changes wear and tear on my car and my time put in, Take off the no tip required on the website pay more per mile to compensate for gas oil changes tires and maintenance on cars
﻿4 years and going strong!, I have just celebrated my 4-year Uberversary at Uber and I continue to love the people I work with. I still find meaning and impact in the work I do. While there are challenges across the company I feel that I have been fortunate to enjoy the better side of the company culture. They have taken care of me and I have learned exponentially more at this company than my previous 4 companies., Mid-level leadership still too junior and poor management from the top in many organizations. Cash compensation is still below market but slowly trending upward., Train new managers on management best practices. There have be "managers" brought in that lead to the mass exodus of my previous team - no one seemed to care.

﻿UberEats driver, Flexible hours Be your own boss, Never worth it Less than 5 dollar an hour Send you far to pick up which you never get pay for that, Better focus on employees not only customers
﻿Awesome Company, * Great work environment * Young and growing company * Career opportunity, * nothing to say yet ., 
﻿Uber is awesome!, I have worked at big tech companies before and i was not happy. Before joining Uber i had my doubts considering all the bad news in the media. However this place is not like how they describe at all. My experience so far is amazing. I love what i do and i am very motivated. Unlike other big tech giants what you do here matters. And we are not trying to make people buy more things or spend more time online (which..., The food could be better and yes there are long work hours and 401k would be nice., We believe in you. Keep doing the right thing.
﻿Pretty Good, Fast Cash Convenient Good Side Hustle, Gas Money Mileage Some Fare Issues Wait Time, 
﻿Brand Ambassador at Demand Team, Energetic and youthful working environment., Not giving good perks. Don't have much respect to intern students., 
﻿Fantastic team great impact amazing 10 year outlook, - Team is fantastic and now with a super strong CEO (and COO etc) and a few org changes it feels everyone is on board to deliver - Vision strategy execution is very solid especially after recent adjustments to org strategy cultural norms (which for some things were an issue in the past) - 10 year outlook is insane for Uber and the industry in passenger transportation food delivery freight self driving cars..., - Compensation could be better but this is gradually improving - Some silos are starting to appear with size but being resolved and not crazy either given size, Stay fairly decentralised and for anyone in HQ or large hubs make sure they add value and centralise what really has huge impact and can be shown to have impact

﻿Great for extra cash flow, Cool to help the people, Sometimes customers can be rude, 
﻿It's a job, Great idea great way to learn a new city (or areas of your city) some quick short-term cash. Write your own schedule so it's great 2nd job for someone with a full-time job with a varied schedule. Also the CEO was recently replaced and I have heard nothing but great things about the new leadership., It's a losing proposition for the drivers long term. Get paid 70 cents a mile (and a pittance for time) but with federal guidelines being it costs 53.5 cents a mile to operate a vehicle and travel to pick up a customer not counted) my records show I am spending $2 for every $1 I make. Also it's the nature of the business but there is simply too much down time., We need to find a way to make the compensation worthwhile to keep drivers around long term
﻿A great place to work- but be prepared for constant not so positive changes, Amazing medical benefits very good pay relaxed atmosphere, Lack of structure very high turnover rate for senior level management doesn't think things through before releasing products/updates/logic changes. Prone to hearsay from gossip- a lot of "facebookesque" drama., Keep the good people that actually work hard and care. Be fair when taking action. LOOK AROUND at what others are also doing. When taking action on someone be sure to ACTUALLY investigate both sides of the story- you'd be surprised what you'd find.

﻿Great place to work, In spite of scandals fantastic company to work for., Distractions due to public-facing nature of the company., 
﻿Uber charges so much by the time you calculate everything time spent and gas there is NOTHING LEFT!, Only if you are in a pinch to bridge a ride somewhere on your way, DO NOT DRIVE FOR UBER, LOWER YOUR FEES.

﻿Account Representative, Uber is a great place to workvery professional and friendly company.Uber looks after there employee's., The Salary is Poorthat is all, IMO.Have a better Salary scale.i.e Bonus Structure or yearly Salary reviews.I find this very strange that a company of this stature has not got something like this in place to reward the hard work.

﻿Executive Assistant, - Fast paced environment that is always growing and adapting need to be able to think on your feet! -Opportunity to work with some of the smartest/ hardworking people in tech - Great culture and perks, - Can be stressful at times juggling multiple bosses across different teams, 
﻿Great JOb, you get to pick your own time. Uber is also great because you can consider yourself as your own boss. there is no one there to tell you what to do but only yourself., the downside can only be when there is maybe weather related issues that can affect you driving outside especially the snow. sometimes like in iowa city when the students from university of iowa go home for the holidays business go down., this is a great job and i like the way that it is kept up ti date all the time but i would like us to start getting paid for the miles driven when we are looking for customers but havent got any yet.
﻿Account Representative Uber Eats, Amazing team and work-life balance. Uber is doing a great job hiring the right culture to keep a healthy working environment., No job is perfect but this is pretty close., 
﻿Lots of mobility and room to have an impact, - Able to get promotions and move upwards if you work hard. I worked as a contractor for over a year and received steady promotions until the company created a position for me to come on board as a full time employee. - Eats is growing enormously quickly and there's a lot of room for someone with passion to have an impact. If you have good ideas and work at them you can bring about significant change - The best people..., - Still carry the problems of 'Uber 1.0' when Travis ran things and we made a lot of bad choices - Disorganized. Great if you can proactively solve problems but if you want a lot of structure this isn't the organization for you., Do not suffocate new business prospects in the name of becoming profitable.
﻿Most exciting company in our time, It's a great place to start a career. In a world where data is king Working at Uber gives one the opportunity to make data-driven decisions each day. It's exciting and challenging at the same time. Each executed project brings growth to the company and the individuals. It's fulfilling to see how your projects have impacted business. What drives me is the growth opportunity and the lives my work is able to touch..., There is so much work to do which is great. But learn to take some time out every now and then,

﻿Uber eats Delivery Driver, very convient for your own time. Fast response from Uber in terms of feedback or help., Sometimes the pay isnt the best, 
﻿Not a great job, , , 
﻿Driver, You get to create your own schedule, The GPS doesn't always work when making Uber Eats deliveries, 
﻿A bright future if you're willing to work hard, Super smart people who really want to make a difference. Real ambition to change things for the better and to address some of the issues (operational and reputational) that have plagued us., Pace of change is relentless. A lot of growing pains while we wrestle with our scale and growth., Communicate more proactively and consistently.
﻿Ubereats, You can work when you want Earn extra cash to keep you going between paycheck and you are your own boss., The pay in mileage distance changes often. If you pickup two deliveries at the same time Uber will cheat you out your money. You get two for one deal. Its best to do one order at a time. Otherwise they will steal from under your noise and take you tip money. Pay attention to your mileage because Uber will cheat you If you try to resolve money issues they will cover up. Only do this part time. They take advantage of their..., Stoping cheating. Uber drivers out of mileage and money. We are making money for the company and ourselves but Uber wants it all and pay little.
﻿Spotty., It is far less stressful to deliver food to a stranger than it is to invite a stranger into your personal vehicle obviously. There are also some people who just insist that you take a tip...and those tips can be pretty sweet., I think there were possibly too many drivers in the areas where I was hoping to get the most deliveries. I had trouble with keeping track of the food when they allowed more than one delivery per restaurant. There were a couple of times when I gave the wrong food to the customer., I think Uber has enough people telling them how to run their business. I suppose I would say that they should give priority for deliveries to people who have a car leased through Uber. If you can't pay your lease you can't continue to work for them....
﻿Watch your Uber earnings, Uber is good if you don't have or want a job or if you need some cash quickly or as a part time thing for some extra pocket money. Only good if you are really strapped for cash., Don't expect to make much if your doing deliveries in Toronto or the GTA you make under minimum wage after gas and filing your taxes. Restaurants make you wait so long for food sometimes and it really dips in to your pocket as a driver. Also Uber is always readjusting fares they paid you so after the trip it may say for example you made 5.75 for the trip a day or 2 later you may or may not get a notification that..., listen to your drivers pay fairly stop making fare adjustments after the fact pay fairly when drivers pick up 2 deliveries from one place penalize restaurants for long wait times by making them pay a fee to the driver for waiting long Show what areas need more drivers on the map and show which areas already have a lot of drivers. Make a button for restaurants to confirm in the app to the driver that the order is...
﻿This is a Negative Expectation Job, No pressure to give money to the homeless because you won't have any., This is a negative expectation job because you put as much if not more resources than you get out of it. The biggest issue is that there are very few tips. Since the beginning of time delivery drivers and hotel room service people have been tipped. Not with Ubereats. Imagine this scenerio. You are in SF on your bike on the North Side of town you get a ping that sends you to Downtown and it says 13 minutes. So..., No advice. Ubereats is not a job it is a nightmare.

Weed out the sincere and focus on those to avoid losing those that keep your business going. I have been able to benefit by being able to pay small recurring bills get gas in a crunch and use as spending money when I can. I've also met some really nice people found great restaurants and little unknown places in my city. It comes at a...
﻿Not impressed 👎🏾, You determine your own schedule!, Low pay. Paid less than minimum wage. Maybe 20% of customers pay a tip. Routed to resturaunts that are 17-20 minutes from you location and are not compensated and the pay for the trip is likely under 4 bucks! The UBER GPS SYSTEM SUCKS it’s inaccurate a lot of the time AND routes you the longest way possible!, Incourage customers to tip! Should be a policy to not route drivers to travel to a resturaunt anymore than 10-12 minutes out their radius.
﻿Great place to work, The culture is great with a lot of benefits and steep learning curve, I thoroughly enjoyed my time their so don't think of anything, 
﻿Uber, Several opportunities to develop yourself There is no bureaucratization, HR very disorganized Poor communication between areas, people are important
﻿Driver, Always cheate with hber driver .you guys are steal money from refferal bonus, This is really unfair with me .i refer to my friend and he complete his 50 rides and when we done with our commitment then now you guys r giving us just 150$ wen you promise us to pay 350$, 
﻿The worst company you can ever work for, I wouldn't recommend working for Uber to Anyone, Can't make the minimum wage . Very Cheap, Work on your ethic . You are so arrogant
﻿Getting better, Uber now allows drivers to accept tips on-app. Not only that but they also pay for your trip to pickup the rider (>10mins) and charge based on distance traveled if the rider cancels, Support is still lacking with personal assistance, 
﻿It is fun it keeps me free. I can make my own schedule., I get to socialize with customers and work with my friends. I can work anytime I want and as much as I want. Easy way to make money., Lose money by having to refill gas with the money I just made. Some customers don't respect the car by trashing the interior or slamming doors. Some customers have an attitude., Make trips closer to give drivers a better chance to make a profit.

﻿Driver, Uber keeps me busy whenever I am driving. I love the freedom of working when I want to work., Uber Eats is not the best. If it is a downtown restaurant parking is rarely close to the business. Then you wait 5 minutes for the order. In that time wasted you can get another ride., It would be nice if they gave us busy areas to work. I.e. Tips for areas to work in.

However a large proportion of the work force at Uber do not.

The other night I sat in a restaurant hoping to get one last delivery in to..., 
﻿Driver, Create your schedule. Additional cash for crunches for short-term, Not worth it after wear and tear on vehicle and gas. You rarely get tipped. If you do its a measly $2 generally. You are more prone to accidents driving in peak hours of rain and dark The incentives fluctuate far to often in terms of comp for you to rely on this If something goes wrong and you only have a short 4 hour window to deliver when rates are highest look forward to the notorious overseas call center where..., Raise the pay.

﻿Concept is better than the pay, Flexibility low barrier to entry, Disgustingly low driver pay rates; lip service to benefits for IC's; bonuses in some markets are easily achieved but a joke;, You have a lot of driver/partners who have left other professional careers where they have been successful. You might want to listen to some of them and ditch some of the kids who work for you in management decision-making. Uber needs to look at the airline industry and decide if they want to end up like PeopleExpress or do they want to end up like Delta. The taxi industry has been defeated. Whichever service...
﻿Dont work for Uber., None zip zero zilch nada, Work extra long hours for below minimum wage pay. News station in Vegas did a bit on this topic stating that the average wage after uber takes their "25"% cut when it is closer to 33% or higher and any deductions you pay for gas meals snacks milage on the vehicle and anything else is about $3/hour you take home while Uber makes millions a day off us dumbies who work for them or pays to use them., 
﻿Software Engineer, - Exciting product very interesting problems to solve - Strong mobile team good developer experience. - Culture encourages knowledge sharing and collaborations, - Feel unfairly treated in terms of compensation. Coworkers joined earlier getting 10x more equities. Compensation is not based on competency and hard working at all. Feel not motivated finantially., Fix compensation
﻿Good benefits but rapid change is not always good, Competitive base pay. Great medical benefits wellness/cell phone reimbursement and food/snacks are provided. Company seems to have a bright future ahead of it., Internal mobility/promotion is a long and tedious process. In the last 6 months pay job duties shifts and just about everything has changed and mostly for the worse. VO job feels insecure and unstable - feels like management is trying to tighten the rules to find excuses to fire people to avoid having to hand out layoff packages., Stop rolling out features and missions before they're anywhere close to ready and then telling operations to deal with it because it's our job. It puts our job security and safety at risk on the road and makes this job a lot more stressful than it needs to be.
﻿Amazing experience, Incredible products that actually change the world super smart people and a culture where anyone can make an impact, Constantly growing environment have to be prepared for change, Start telling stories of what it's actually like to work here...what the media reports isn't representative of this culture
﻿Driver, You enhance your customer services skills learn new things every day know new people and each one of them have a wonderful stories to say and also making connections, The risk to be on the road you have to be very smart because is a lot bad drivers around the area and thats a big challenge., 
﻿good, nice money on weekends bad pay, i dont like the pay, 
﻿driver, , , 
﻿Some drivers are shifty, Work life balance that’s it, Pay and Uber need to set higher standards when hiring drivers., Make sure like myself that Ubereats drivers follow the rules and can speak clear english. I haven seen a group of ubereats drivers who all know eachother wait in a shopping centre car park for orders to come through I thought the rules were you could only go to restaurant if there is an order to be picked up which is what I do. This takes work away from drivers who do the right thing which is unfair. Please bring in...
﻿Ubereats, Daily cash outs bonuses own hours, Support system miscommunication broken promises, Train the support department to communicate better with the employees
﻿Partner Support Specialist, , , 
﻿Community Support Representative, Great Team Work Environment Salary Food, Needs to improve regarding management and providing opportunities for the internal teams instead of making external recruitment., 
﻿Time, Flexible that is all. You feel like you are your own boss but the real bosses are the one making the real money., The fare is pretty low depreciate the value of your car so fast put a lot of mileage frequent maintenance. long driving hours to earn more. Got to put taxes amount aside, 
﻿Uber is a great opportunity for those who need extra income want to meet people and get to know the areas better., Convenient Easy Sign Up good amount of business referral bonus pay guarantees Great App Riders have no picture Easy pay deposit process, Lower pay than expected not a high integrity kind of company remotely managed with a lack of total support highest pay is 11pm-5am weekends picking up drunks., Give more pay by charging a little more for rides especially the $3-$4 short rides. Or give us a some pay for the ride on the way to pick up a rider especially if it is 20 minutes away.
﻿Driver, Flexibility no boss no schedule, Unresponsive callous management no protections, 
﻿Not worth it!, Earn a little side cash... But when I say little I mean little.!, Lots of wear and tear on your car. Lot of driving around. I gross $3 to $7 hour. That's before tax and before gas and wear and tear on my car. Definitely not worth it., Stop exploiting your drivers! Stop promising and start delivering!
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Nice company to work for, - you learn much while working -data driven -international environment -global exchange programs, -In Ukraine there is an old Russian style management structure when you compare to the west. Whereas if you compare it to other Ukranian companies it can be similar. - GM promoting only his initial team members, Listen & respect employees
﻿Fraud Specialist, Flexible work environment passionate and supportive, little to no opportunity to move up, 
﻿Community Developer/Support, Working at Uber is some kind of a beam light in a room filled with dark Uber is an example of how to run the business so accurate in a timely manner other than that the atmosphere is truly pushing you to improve your skills so neatly i'm proud that i am a part of this company., Recognition if there is something to be downsided i assume that is the recognition Uber isn't really aware of how community developers nor QAs or even content specialists are doing or paying much efforts to done its business this is really a sort of thing to be noted and i hope so., Push your employees to the level where you are.
﻿No TIPS, It’s not work it. You have to get out your car pick the food up and then drop it off. The customers don’t even tip. My last and finally trip was $4.55. No worth my time. Thanks, Add a gratitude for fast service. The Uber Driver is not making any money from it., 
﻿Uber Expert, Great benefits no working weekends monthly credits (which could be higher but I digress) chance to be a part of a growing tech company., Constant communication issues across the organization. Experts are expected to maintain unrealistic performance metrics while maintaining office and city operations duties while being paid less than the industry average for office admin. I could go to a govt job and easily make close to $30/hour for the same duties. Managers are out of touch and do not understand the goings on of the Greenlight Hubs. Remote “site managers”..., No advice because this place is a sinking ship.
﻿Some amazing people, Have learned more in one year than any other company and it's a rocket ship. Some amazing people. I've learned to problem solve more than I've ever have anywhere else., Some of the best culture and some of the worst. There is some amazing stuff that goes on at Uber but there are some really terrible people also., Management is the problem especially upper management.
﻿Knowing more, A free culture where you family time is important, Contract basis so you put your life at risk, 
﻿2nd best Company to work with after Facebook, Very good ambience and working culture Good managers and Colleagues Good facilities like Credits and Goodies, Not Applicable/ No major cons found, Doing great job. Keep it up.
﻿Look beyond the headlines!, Massive global business with tons of opportunities to make an impact., Very large org with lots of silos and overlaps so can be a bit disorienting, 
﻿Less than working at Minimum wage job, Set own hours meet interesting friendly people, Don't make enough money to pay bills too many drivers REALLY a waste of my time and needless wear-and-tear on my car, Pay your drivers more. Limit the number of drivers allowed to be active at any one time. I made $23 after being online for 5 hours New Years Eve and multiple times I will be in the middle of a large surge area and not get any rides
﻿Less than minimum wage no tips and sucky app, The only good thing is the flexibility. You do it when you have the time., Usually takes 2 hours for 4 deliveries in San Antonio TX and you get about $15. That if you’re between noon and 6 pm. If you go late at night or earlier the pay is even less. Customers are told by the app they don’t have to tip. So most of them don’t tip. Many times you end up driving a total of 15 miles (wearing your car and using your gas) to get paid $2.90. But the worst of all is the application map. DONT USE IT...., Fix your inaccurate app and instead of telling people they’re not supposed to tip tell them they’re not under obligation to do it but that it will be good if they do because drivers are not earning even minimum wage with what you pay them. Also please pay us more. To drive back and forth for over 20 minutes (without the waiting at the restaurant/customer) and get paid $2.90 is an insult.
﻿Driver, You get to set your own schedule you meet some very interesting people longer trips are more profitable than the shorter trips, On short rides driver earns less than half of fare there seem to have more promotions only in the larger markets, Listen to driver concerns
﻿good place to work overall, fast paced lots of opportunity if you work hard you will be rewarded, lots of politics taxing to many and can be extremely frustrating, Focus on developing middle management

﻿Good Gig, Decent Pay Lots of opportunities Tipping now, Pay could be better gas is expensive most passengers don't tip, Pay drivers more and offer benefits to full time employees. Give drivers more incentives to work harder and get paid more.
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿A Happy Remote Job, Excellent work environment for me personally. I worked remotely 99% of the time my immediate supervisors were responsive supportive and generally easy to work with., The media and public perception., Pay drivers more it will ease tensions and boost public perception. It's the #1 complaint of current and former drivers.
﻿Comm Ops, BEST people to work with, There are none for this organisation., 
﻿Best Place to Work With, Best : Work atmosphere is really good Growth opportunities are more Friendly environment, As of now no, 
﻿Highs and lows, Very good company culture and perks, can take quite a while to hire internally, 
﻿Good for a little extra money on the side, You can set your own schedule and make some money quickly. You meet some nice people and get to drive where you want., The money you earn is a joke considering what they expect of you. This is the only job I've had where the more experience you get and the better you are the less they pay you. The earnings are low and constantly getting worse. You have very little control over the rides you have to do and where they will go. This might be a good option to earn a little extra money but it is a terrible way to earn a living. ..., Give drivers more freedom and independence or hire us as employees and pay a living wage.
﻿Not worth it, Flexible hours and access to work, Low pay. I’m averaging $13-$17 an hour BEFORE gas costs., No one should be expected to provide a ride to someone in their vehicle and get paid $3.42. I have 108 Five Star ratings and have driven less than 250 passengers but I’m reducing my driving to only do it toward a destination and toward home because it’s not worth the low pay or time. Not to mention the wear and tear on my van.
﻿Professional development is non-existent and so is compensation increments, Perks benefits and free food, There's a clear difference in appreciation for NorthAm employees and support center employees. Changes are always happening swiftly and without your knowledge or extremely last minute. Culture has gone downhill since I've been there (2+ years). Also there's not a clear pathway for career development unless you want to be a team lead or manager. They don't care that you're college-educated. Favoritism (in more ways than..., Get new and better management in the COE starting from the top :)
﻿No More, Freedom of being self-employed Social contact with clients mostly good., Pay is not worth it when you do the math you are paying for the ride. Gas wear and tear on the car mileage depreciation on the car. I lost $550. on this year's taxes., Raise drivers pay  let drivers put in the longest distance they will drive to pick up the fare as this lowers their bottom line.
﻿Driver, Set own hours and you can work around your schedule, getting paid to low for pickups and when I drive to my destination I do not get paid for my mileage or gas and gasping so expensive and cannot afford basically when I make in one night or two nights I end up paying for my gas no tips whatsoever only earning about a dollar to $2 a week, Pay your drivers better giving promotions and incentives give them money to the destination and have the customer give tips give us materials that we need in order to deliver food as well because food arrives cold to a customer due to the fact that we do not carry or can I afford a warm bag to keep the food warm
﻿The pay out is so little you spend more in gas doing it, You pick your Own schedual, Even in an electric car I feel like I’m ripped off on pay out. $5 for 19 min in traffic and over 10 miles away, For the love of god raise the Uber deliveries pay out it costs the drivers more in gas than the pay and we just loose money it’s a joke after 11 of them I am in debt $.30 not cool. Even the regular X rates are a bit too low and you have to drive an electric car to even make min wage
﻿Driver, It's very flexible job but not well paid, it's not a very good paid job., increase driver's payoff. after gas maintenance and tax deduction its nothing left
﻿My current job, Your own boss work anyway and anytime you like, Bad roads causing damage to vehicles rude riders bad navigation due to poor network, The management should be more considerate
﻿Customer operation Specialist III, Great work environment to learn professional skill sets., A very limited growth opportunity., 
﻿Good Environment to work no tensions  treating employees as good.., Organising social parties well and no compromise in cost at all.., No promotions as fast  growth is sometimes in challange and some juniors could be lost in beginning .., Must to be focus on drivers behaviour..
﻿It's ok. Don't make much money, Pick your hours. Work where you want., You can make less than minimum wage (about $7 an hour). The majority of the time you won't get a tip so don't count on that., Since customers have to pay for the delivery charge they don't think they should tip. Need to fix that or inform the customer. Let customers know that the drivers would like to get a tip. Give an icon to show if this person has ordered before and if they tipped. Setup a structure where if they deliver in less than X amount of time they can make more money.
﻿Low income for drivers., Sitting in a surge area and not receiving any request., Raise the fares a little so drivers would more likely to stay on the platform., 
﻿low pay., flexible hours work on own time., they take up t0 70% of a drivers fare  low pay, 
﻿Working at Uber, You can learn a lot from peers and workshops and online classes., Too little pay for the position, Listen to employees
﻿Software Engineering Intern, Fairly good pay they allow overtime hours to be billed Free Uber Credits every month Free Food every day, High pressure environment things change so fast that it is sometimes hard to keep up. Management doesn't seem to care about employee happiness., Pay more attention to how your employees are feeling. Not everything is about turning a profit
﻿Must Play it Smart!, Instant pay Massive adoption by restaurants, Limited work hours Unpredictable income Application issues, Don't try to control your couriers so much. I can't go to another app without the Uber app shooting to the front and interfering. I can't look at anything else in the app while I am on a trip even if I am just waiting for an order to be ready.
﻿Okay but not great, Good pay young team great working conditions, A tendency from mamagement to treat low level staff like spoiled children instead of working intellingent adults., 
﻿Uber is awesome!, Creative environment professional people amazing facilities., No constructive criticism at the moment., Keep up the good work!
﻿Uber Driver, , , 
﻿Ubereats, Flexible. You truly work whenever you want 24/7., Restaurants dont have food ready. Driver gets the blame, Take notes on restaurant repeat offenders
﻿Driving for Uber, Flux ability of work hours, Hours worked to make a living, Pay drivers more
﻿No HR no transparency no empathy., I guess theirs some "free" food no drug tests and a great place for young people with little to no experience to be handling complex financial issues of customers - if that's your thing..., Paychecks often wrongs employees repremanded for taking earned pto blackoutdates people fired for taking their earned paid sick time while on sick time people terminated for subjective performance reviews management favoritism doctoring of data 20 year olds in charge of your account security no HR contacts or replys harrasment bad management no phone/fax/department for employees to call with issues and non..., Don't fire people for made up reasons with little to no investigation into management's claims - just because they are in right to work states and signned arbitration agreements and just because there's zero recourse for the employee doesn't mean you shouldn't have a conscience. Internal hiring tests are a joke and not fairly administered test answers given to management's favorite candidates. Quit doctoring employee's...
﻿Turning the corner, Great people with a good mission and ready and willing to change. They are poised to do really great things., A lot of baggage - a history of well documented challenges and brand perception get in the way sometimes, 
﻿Pick and choose your spots, surges work as own boss you drive as a job, too many drivers your car won't last long, pay us more
﻿DRIVER, Flexible hours You are your own boss low stress Company makes themselves available to requests Able to work anywhere in the country Direct deposit Relatively safe, Pay is not good when factors like gasoline wear and tear on the vehicle are factored in. Unable to use a rental car in the area Puts many many miles on car If car breaks down no way ti rent another one, Improve pay to drivers
﻿Uber Driver, Freedom to work anytime Chances to earn good money, Sometimes driving for long hours is exhausting and tiring, 
﻿HATE UBER EATS, Stupid job to work and make Uber rich they are selfish not pay you anything, Wait 10 to 20 min avarage to get the food ready no tips not enough moaney beatup your car and put alot of milge on the car in end you just pay for gas and making Uber eats rich hate this job, Care more about your employee s they are the one making this company rich every boady that drivers I know they have same feeling and hate this job and keep quiting after while everybody find out I hope no one doesn't work for you guys
﻿Stay away your getting conned, None or maybe you get to choose your hours (that your getting ripped off), Shady company does not care about drivers only about riders if that. Some people don't get it but sometimes you work for $ 9 to $ 10 an hour after you deduct expences fuel taxes and knees fees., Shut it down your already running a 2.5 billion loss every year.
﻿What UberEats drivers get paid should be illegal, Being able to set your own hours, Very low pay compared to regular Uber trips ( you can make about 4 times more for same distance & time., Increase the delivery fairs before you lose drivers for UberEats.
﻿Uber Driver, Work your own hours Uber is adding things to benefit the drivers, The Uber map can be a little spotty, 
﻿Customers, Easy Pay. Some nice riders interesting stories., Very long trips or hazardous road conditions., Some riders are very difficult to get along with.
﻿Driver, More wear on my car than expected. Car expenses add up to a lot so not very good money., Make the compensation structure more transparent., 
﻿Senior Software Engineer, Very interesting technical challenges in every area( also interesting to learn the ones already solved ). There are lot of cross training education activities happening all the time at Uber., Very fast moving but one can expect from a growing company., Should get better at retaining employees.
﻿It is what it is, , , 
﻿Tons of opportunity but you sacrifice personal life, Career growth get tons of experience fast  people are amazing and driven tons to do so you can never get bored, Long Hours can be very negative and competitive confused corporate vision it will take over your life if you let it, Prioritize look after your people
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Account Manager, The company is expanding so quickly that they can hardly keep on top of things. The company is outpacing the tech the manpower and the ability to keep their employees happy. The pay is crap it's a 'great for your resume' type job. No clear career advancement opportunities., Take your employees seriously. Right now you focus so much energy on expanding and on keeping the highest people happy and they do NOT treat their employees on lower levels well. I was a contractor for nearly 2 years with no benefits PTO or sick time. It really sucked., 
﻿Agent at Uber Public Relarions Student, you can be yourself work in team to make good relations, doesn't have cons if you think there are you can said., 
﻿Risk Analyst, Team is amazing good cafeteria food good pay and above all work is challenging and fascinating, Not any I can think of, 
﻿Sr Manager Research and Customer Insights, Great company / culture built with smart people looking to make a change and positive difference in people's lives., Probably improve my work life balance, Keep up the good work we're only at the start!!
﻿OK way to make some money when you're desperate, Some decent conversation sometimes. If you wait around long enough you might be able to pay your rent., I struggle a lot lately (Dec-Jan) to find rides . Drunk people are the worst. I would say 70% of sober people don't know how to use the app - you have to adjust the pick up spot. I'm not going to harass you to tell me where you are for me to blame me for not knowing. Faulty GPS at times., Education program
﻿Uber, I can be my own boss  I can set own hours I can take breaks when I want I can work anywhere in Oklahoma, Uber has High turnover rate on employees Uber seems to higher and higher and higher so we as subcontractors have no room to grow or achieve any goals., Uber is a great concept and also Uber has a lot of potential with PR that they don't even recognize. Each City should only have enough drivers so every driver that's driving for Uber can make a living and make a profit. Uber needs to concentrate on what is happening now instead of the future for Uber....
﻿Screwed Things Up With Their Changes Week of 1/22/18, Weekly Pay Work when you want, Took away obtainable bonuses, Put things back the way they were. With your changes of 1/22/18 my pay dropped $140 last week and this week isn't starting out any better. You are going to force good people to work for other delivery companies.
﻿Morale downer, work when you want. some friendly customers. views of city. some incentives such as free taxes and ubereats coupons. they do try to keep you in your area., wear and tear on car. gas lasts less than one week. people are so unforgiving when you get lost thanks to the faulty gps. they threaten you with a ratings score and when youre new no one tells you the ropes. you have to learn by error. make less than minimum wage. the time in between trips is not the best., please give more incentives that are reasonable for part time employees. I feel like a monkey slave.
﻿COE, Great Environment and good office, Can't think of anything right now, 
﻿Great company!, Incredibly company to work for always a new and exciting element to the business and my management team treated me as equal and were an amazing support network., Communication to Experts sometimes quite poor but only on rare occasions, 
﻿Uber Expert 1, 3 month training period which allows for an initial 2 weeks of shadowing followed by hands on experience. 1st day I was given a brand new Mac work laptop with wireless keyboard mouse ipad! Tons of resources to aid you while working with the Uber Driver Partners with their issues. Face to Face customer service (no phone interactions). Security on shift. Free lunch daily with a kitchen full of snacks and drinks. Comfortable..., Cannot be an Uber Driver while on payroll. Deal with difficult customer service issues Become familiar with a lot of different programs Mis-information on the web and old information is a challenge to correct, 
﻿The best job I ever had., The team is great I work with people committed with their goals and the enterprise's goals. The environment is so nice and I am learning a lot about people about team-work etc. I am really happy to work here., For must of us is difficult to stop thinking about the enterprise and how to develop new ideas or solve any issue., 
﻿Part Time, It's very Flexible main reason why i still drive for Uber, Wear and tear on your vehicle, 
﻿Good and Bad, entirely flexible schedule pay when i choose comfortability, not easy to communicate sometimes app malfunctions not very good pay for uber eats, make a call line.
﻿A job that enlightens one on the human condition., -Wonderful social experience for those seeking jobs which entail interaction. -Decent pay when business is busy. -Fantastic opportunity to expand connections. -Deep conversations life stories of riders. -A memorable self-employment experience., -No opportunities for job growth. -Occasional negative encounters with riders. -Limited Benefits. -Inconsistent pay., 
﻿Account Manager, , , 
﻿Greenlight Coordinator, 1. Empowerment in your role 2. Compensation and acknowledgement of efforts 3. Future in business, 1. Fast pace of work too many changes 2. Stressfull environments, 
﻿Uber Driver, Set your own hours Opportunity to work as many hours as you want cash out whenever you'd like., Wear and tear on your own vehicle the app crashes regularly., 
﻿Great company easy job but only worth as a side gig, - great if you love to drive - great if you love talking to people - easy scheduling on your own time, - not much room to move up if you're a driver - sometimes uncomfortable situations, 
﻿Fun while it lasted, The free lunch was amazing and enjoyable!, Closed down our location and moved the jobs to San Fran., Keep growing but hire more leaders with experience.
﻿Reasonable company, Fewer politics(except for the one played at very top) No toxic atmosphere with negative reviews(which was present in past), Most systems are premature(except for the main Maps/mobile). If you get stuck in Benefits questions or laptop (ussh) then you will go around in circle(there is no single phone number or IT chat) Watch out for Salary Negotiation team., The management is new so don't know the pros/cons. But they seem to be honest.(but maybe not as visionary as Travis)
﻿Worst Company I have EVER worked with, Freedom to work when you want... Meet nice people once in a while... That's about it., They are taking more than 25% from what they quote. They are actually taking about 35-45%. This means that you are making barely anything before you add in the other expenses that you are getting such as gas insurance car payment damages if any cleaning every day and the overall stress of dealing with people that treat you like you are being paid the right amount for them to step on you. The company does not..., Start caring about your drivers or you will end up becoming just a trash excuse of a public transit. At least with public transits the company pays for the car/bus/train and the employees get benefits. There is none here and the pay is just as much as working for McDonalds.
﻿Great Supplemental Income, I can work whenever I want and get to meet interesting people., Unruly customers and pay can seem a little low for some rides, Pay drivers more per ride

﻿Uber driver and material god, , , 
﻿Easy Money, be your own boss and earn when you want, not enough orders sometimes, 
﻿Challenging but rewarding!, The biggest contrast to other large companies I've worked for has been the quality of the people at Uber. Everyone at Uber is motivated switched on and willing to help. People trust you to deliver and management provide you with the right balance of autonomy and support to achieve quality work., The job is often very demanding. The organisation moves quickly and you have to be always on to keep up., -
﻿Too many drivers, Choose your schedule. But you ll have to be on the road when it's busy so in the end you're not really free to choose your schedule, No more business probably end up in bankruptcy. Rides are very cheap for new York. Also the car maintenance will take all the profit if there is any!, Take care of the old drivers with more experience
﻿Good job for extra income, Working when you want taking as many breaks not having anyone to answer to boost areas and daily promotions for drivers, Restaurants make you wait when drivers should be requested when the meal is ready for pickup they don't pay for gas or give gas discounts for UberEats only partners less than 30% of uber eats customers tip because they don't know that you can add a tip as soon as the driver ends the ride but most people don't go back into the app until the next time they order and it usually is too late to add a tip, Asking a customer if they want to add a tip should be done before they place the order like every other normal online delivery order services. Drivers should also be given either a discount on gas or a set price for driving to the restaurant depending how far it is away from the driver
﻿Uber, Learn a maximum in a minimum of time, work balance is not ideal, work on people management
﻿The best experience in a great company, Inclusive Great work environment Excellent benefits The best people, Until now I do not have any Cons, 
﻿the best enterprise I ever worked for, the enterprise culture help us to develop our qualities in the best way possible., we represent the face of uber that means we can be "beaten", keep prospecting our values
﻿Learning Manager- 3 months employment feedback, Taking care about employees keeping work-life balance great development opportunities employee-friendly environment, None everything works perfect for me, 
﻿The job is manageable and challenging., Ideal company who wants to develop new skills up for a challenge with good atmosphere and career growth., Management and leadership is too lenient and considerable which is why most of the employees take advantage of this. Employees are too complacent and slack off. The managers and supervisors no longer observes or provides coaching on a regular basis., In regard to employees' complacency at work the management must look into this. About coaching employees should be coached on a weekly basis. Leadership should know the challenges our teammates facing with their job and responsibilities at work and outside work that affects their performance. I understand we are not BPO company but regardless of industry coaching is a must to gauge people retention to provide SMART...
﻿Operation Consultant, There are no pros that come to my mind, Pay below market standards Experience does not count, 
﻿Expert II, Solid benefits...but that's about it., The pay is extremely low for the situations you have to deal with and lower than the market average. There is no growth opportunities within the company and they foster a competitive environment. Workplace is cliquy and they change your schedule without telling you., LISTEN to your employees and implement changes that they can benefit from. Provide the support that they're looking for and the growth opportunities they deserve.
﻿Great opportunity, The flexibility is excellent work at your own pace .Be your own boss is very true and pay is not to bad., You have to work long hours sometimes to meet your bottom line., Pay for drivers need to increase.

﻿Female Driver; Glitches but Great Opportunity, I've been driving w/ Uber 17 months my rating is 4.7. I've driven in several large cities including Miami & D.C. The opportunities are endless if you learn how to maximize. This is not an easy task & requires work & study of the environment in which you choose to work. That is true of any job especially when independent., Caveat: Uber oversaturates with drivers & fails to maintain real-time surge opportunities. New less experienced and/or hapless drivers create a disadvantage for seasoned & professional drivers thereby forcing us to expend extra time & cost to reestablish a balance previously established. Not cool., Stop oversaturating the market with drivers. Create & maintain incentives for exemplary drivers audit other drivers utilizing the expertise of exemplary drivers & communicate with your pro's to gain a better handle on the wants & needs of your clientele especially women who find themselves in awkward situations with unsavory drivers.
﻿Driver, Meeting new people flexible schedule, Lack of bonus  Uber makes it difficult to obtain bonus dishonest, 
﻿On the right track, I joined in October 2017 and wouldn't have joined under the former CEO. The current vision and leadership of the company is inspiring and it's headed in the right direction.

﻿Uber Driver New Orleans, Flexible schedule. Busiest days Thursday through Sunday. On average I can earn $20-$22/hour and I just work in the daytime. Drivers who work at night on the weekends earn about 20-30% more., No cons. I enjoy the flexibility and the boost that this supplements my main source of income., 
﻿Why does Ubser as a company exist??, So called independence!! Good between jobs, A scenario: Picked up an Uberpool passenger No 1 and Uber automatically added another passenger on the way. I drove almost 2 hours driving miles in Atlanta busy traffic. Scenario 2: The passenger was charged $ 48.00 and Uber driver received $26.00 and Uber company got $22.00 Scenario 3: A driver is the front line service provider and bears wears and tears of the car vehicle costs and service Fuel charges and..., Do not mislead drivers in the name of independent contractor!!

﻿Couldn't find the county courthouse if they were in it my GPS from 1989 works better than their 100 billion dollar app, meeting new people is all, waste of time people leave low ratings for no reason (taxi drivers etc) dealing w/ drunks wear/tear on your vehicle. Don't pay anything near what they advertise claim $29/hr in my city more like $9 / her totally absurd! |Tech support non-existant..... have reinstalled the Driver aPP 15x in 4 weeks still won't load right.

﻿Amazing environment to work in: both exciting and relaxing, Uber is a rapidly growing company that is fundamentally changing the ways of people's lives all around the world.

It's a great balance., Unfortunately Uber has received bad external reputation last year. As someone working here I don't feel anything uncomfortable.

﻿Exciting work environment but challenging, Opportunities to work on what interests you the most Engaging work environment Culture of experimentation Growth potential is very exciting and you'll feel a genuine sense of accomplishment on major projects that drive results, Compensation is low relative to similar companies Managers are more focused on bottom line results than supporting their teams Hard-driving work culture can lead to burnout Constantly shifting goals and priorities to balance with management changes Opportunities for promotions are centralized in San Francisco Chicago and DC, Encourage more internal promotions and diversify hiring practices to include people with different professional experiences in management roles — i.e. not just MBA grads with a consulting background.
﻿Is it worth it?, Your own schedule. Meeting new people., There is no way to make a decent living driving for Uber in Kansas City. I average $10/hour on good days after gas but before insurance and car wear and tear. People don't tip and trash your car. You drive for 20 minutes for a $2 fare., Fix the pay structure. It is rediculous that uber can make $6 in a fare when I make only $3
﻿Low Earning, You are the manager of your own time., A very low level of income given that your own car wears out while working for this company., Pay attention to your partners they are PEOPLE who need to have a decent earning.
﻿Uber rideshare, Uber is a great job for managing time and familiarizing ones self with the city.It is easy to learn and the opportunities are a finger tip away., Uber puts a lot of wear and tear on your vehicle. A complaint from a passenger can disable your account for days and cause you to lose money., I understand that money is the objective but the drivers need to be considered as more valuable than in the past. I think they should be compensated a little better for the great service they provide.
﻿Not enough money, , , 
﻿On boarding, Uber has a young and vibey working environment the team is made up of a diverse number of people and every day you learn something new., Because Uber is such a largely known global brand I expected to be incentivised more for my work., 
﻿Murp, Work when you want to., Pay is not worth time, Better support messaging center
﻿Love driving with Uber!, I work when I want for however long I want. I've steadily increased my weekly pay every week since I started and from what I see my excellent passenger ratings and acceptance rate have influenced the number of ride requests I've received. Checking the rider app there will be multiple drivers on duty closer to a rider and I will get the request. This obviously inspires me to continue providing my riders with the..., Driver help line connects to operators in another country who so far have not solved any of my issues. They deliver canned responses repeatedly never actually addressing my problem., Provide local support for drivers when they are unable to get help via the help line.
﻿The best company that I have ever worked for!, Definitely one of the greatest takeaways from working with Uber Freight was helping start with the new division. The management knows exactly what they are doing and the work balance life was amazing., I honestly have no cons worth mentioning. This was absolutely the greatest place that I have ever worked in my life and I hate that I had to leave., The only complain to management was that some of them worked remotely in Chicago (I worked in the SF office) and it would have been great to have them local sometimes.
﻿Great flexible job, - Work when you want - Surge pricing (fee multiplier for busy areas) - Decent pay - good for students/supplemental income - Be your own boss, - Must keep driver score above certain level (I never had issues with this) - May not have consistent work depending on area - No benefits self-employment tax, Offer benefits for drivers who want to do it full-time.
﻿Not impressed :(, Flexible schedules work on your own time., Driver side app totally sucks!!! Constant navigation issues acceptance rates randomly goes down even after accepting ALL rides. Terrible driver services probably outsourced to somewhere they don't speak very good English. An absolute joke., Fix your app make it work properly and stop randomly screwing around with my acceptance rates!!!! Or at least send drivers a reliable GPS system so we don't have to cancel rides because the navigation is not working because you aren't doing your jobs!!!
﻿Driver, None. Not a recommended job., Poor pay Unappreciated Not safe. Lots of drink and high customers that rate poor,

Flexible hours: I turn on the app when ever I feel like making some extra money. Boost rates: this is the time when you can make decent money. Depending on your area. Extra money. This is a good extra side income and that’s it. Don’t go in thinking you are gonna be able to..., Miles on your car: You do pack on the miles on your car. But if you are signing up for this job you should have already assumed that Pay is low. This is not a job to make a living off of. You can definitely make more taking a minimum wage job over this job., Change the UberEATS app section that says tips are optional to we appreciate your tip. When you go to a restaurant you don’t see that on your check at a restaurant so why put it on your app especially since you don’t pay enough to cover a customers tip.
﻿Uber Eats, instant pay was awesome and it was a stress free job, the only con is switching between cards to receive funds, 
﻿Uber eats Delivery Partner, Flexibility work anywhere on the island. Some incentives and there is no boss to pressure you. The map which shows the way to the food stop is quite accurate., The rain inhibits us from delivering low pay and we have to travel so far sometimes. No name for short lanes or shortcuts on the app map., Increase the boost multiplier or increase our incentives without decreasing boost multiplier.
﻿Sucks, The discounts connected with uber are okay, Don't pay enough driver app is horrible none of customer support speaks good English nor will they directly answer your question will block your account and launch investigations without telling you anything., Hire people who speak better English fix that sorry driver app increase fare rates (including minimum fare) stop with the halfass support responses and emails.

﻿Well it beats minimum wage i guess, Pick your own hours. Fun if you like to drive. Fun if you like to find new places to eat. Instant pay to a debit card., Your boss is a fussy computer. Economy driven income. Expenses to do the task consume 25% or more of earnings. i.e. commercial insurance phone and car maintenance. Don't expect tips. The app gets the directions wrong often., Any advice is ignored... seriously. To a person wondering... pick a city open all hours and beware of hurricane season.
﻿Uber expert, • great family culture • time off when needed • free lunch daily •, The interactions with partners can be difficult sometimes, Management is understanding and works well with employees
﻿Great company on the rise (hopefully) again, Great compensation benefits perks and a showering of Uber credits each month. Team is incredibly welcoming and warm. Work is rewarding., Negative press dispersed and distributed responsibilities and ownership, As of this review our new CEO has been at the helm for 3 months. No advice yet
﻿Independent Contractor Driver, You decide your own hours., Dealing with a company that could care less about drivers with its only concerns about its bottom line profits., Treat your drivers well. The better you treat your drivers the better your drivers will represent your company.
﻿New level of being exploited, Kinda flexible. You can’t drive when there is no demand., Low fares that don’t support a fair living wage combined with way over saturated with drivers makes this gig nearly impossible to survive at. There is a reason that only 4% of drivers make it over a year., It’s hopeless.
﻿Just something to do. Not much as far as income, Can work at your own pace. No set schedule., Oversaturation of market area. When I started in 2016 there was more demand than supply. Don't expect to see the numbers that Uber states are obtainable. Drivers are just a number and not part of a team. Money made doesn't begin to cover your time energy and wear and tear on your vehicle. Most of the time you are worko by for minimum wage or lower., Start treating and paying drivers fairly and treat them as an asset rather than an expendable liability.
﻿Uber is a Plantation Economy Disguised as a Gig Economy, Flexibility is the only reliable function., Uber is a con. Income is leveraged on drivers assuming large amounts of risk with very little return. They mislead drivers on surge and boost pricing. You often pick up a rider in a surge zone but won't get paid for it. They are stealing from the drivers with post fare "adjustments" in which they take money out of your fare if you divert from their "suggested" route. It may be pennies on the dollar but they are..., Run a moral business.
﻿Uber People Ops - Activation Center, Benefits are great they are what you expect from a tech giant, Company's policies and processes change with local regulations, 
﻿Uber Eats review, Able to work when you want, Can get slow and you can make as $4 an hour, 
﻿Life at a COE, -Fun and friendly work environment -GREAT benefits, -Hours are not ideal (ever) -All employees are underpaid -Promoting is nearly impossible -No 401K matching, Work on providing higher levels of feedback as well as growth opportunities. Keep recruited and promotions internal.
﻿Uber Driver, You can drive when you want and make pretty good money., You have to pick up people without knowing where they are going ahead of time., To update the “Uber Driver” app with the opportunity for the driver to see where the rider wants to go before hand.
﻿Terrible Company, Flexible Schedule and ability to earn tips (Finally)., Very little compensation Uber makes more money than the Driver taking passengers. Benefits are disgusting. Can never contact a person at Uber or find help on their Website., Give more to the people using their cars dealing with obstacles on the road and handling your customers.
﻿UBER is ABUSIVE TO DRIVERS NATIONWIDE, Drivers begin working for UBER with a high level of enthusiasm. That lasts about 2-3 weeks and it's downhill from there. In Week #1 a Driver is energized at the earning potential promoted by UBER on their website "Earn great pay . . .", But UBER quotes GROSS REVENUE examples as actual 'pay'. They never quote the NET HOURLY earnings after deductions for: 1. Car 2. Gas 3. Insurance 4. Cell phone service 5. Car washes 6. Tires 7. Brake Pad replacement 8. Car registration 9. Maintenance 10. Clothing etc. etc. UBER reduced fares so low that a Driver needs to work 60+ hours to earn the equivalent of 40 hrs of income. Low fares = Low income. UBER..., UBER the drivers built your company into a $40B valuation. Show some appreciation and cut your 20% to 8% promote tipping aggressively and stop jerking Drivers around.

﻿Uber is not worth the expense., Instant pay; set your own schedule., Even for long trips; the fare you get is pathetic when you take into account gas and depreciation of your vehicle. It winds up being next to nothing. The only people making a killing are the owners at Uber. You can count on that., It may not be a complete scam but it is next thing to it.

﻿Expert 1, This company has such a great work environment and my co-workers are awesome. Everyone gets along and there is no drama; we really do consider ourselves family. We always have a high level of energy every day and its makes the days go by in a blink of an eye. We build close relationships with drivers which makes work feel like a second home. There is lots of room to grow with the company if your looking for something..., If you are the type of person who cannot handle confrontation whether its in a good or bad situation this probably is not the right occupation to take on., Management is great!
﻿Community Support Represenative, - co-workers - atmosphere - culture of the company - perks, - flat salary no chance for a rise - no opportunity for personal development - no free weekends mostly at work, 
﻿A great place to interact with technology, Working in one of the most fast growing technology companies sets you on the path of interacting with technology and keeps you up to date with modern society updates., Keeping up with the updates that occurs on daily basis is one of the most difficulties of the job to be honest if you are used to routine careers this place is not for you!, Management overall is great it's an open door environment after all however More interaction with employee's would be much appreciated.
﻿Greenlight Expert, At this point there is very little that is positive about working here apart from the health insurance Lyra mental health coverage (which is beyond essential) and a 401k. But those can be available at most jobs., Poor pay horribly managed environment mistreatment by drivers blatant sexism and favoritism unqualified people getting promotions and emotional exhaustion & burnout. Also HR rarely pays attention to reports of unethical & illegal activity., CHANGE. Treat your employees well. Don’t drive your employees to a point where they have mental breakdowns because of sexual harassment and burnout.
﻿Bad Driver Rating System, Flexible and ability to work when you want., Fares have gone down for drivers. We do not get paid as much and working too much to make what we used to. Uber manipulates the math. There are times when you get a rider who does not like you has an issue and decides to take it out on you by the ratings and gives you the lowest possible score and lodges a complaint against you. Uber support will NOT help you out or even listen to you about it. Clearly the rankings..., Fix the rating system for drivers to reverse any ratings and rankings against a rider who does revenge rankings.
﻿An enjoyable place to work, people atmosphere benefits locality interesting, have yet to find one, The training is spot on. I love particularly how there is no hard and fast rule for different incidents. I also love how you feel your opinion is taken into consideration. Also love the freedom you have to make your own judgement and actions within reason.
﻿Uber takes a lions share of you earnings, Work when you want, Seeing how much Uber takes from your earning, 
﻿driver, you boss of your time, passengers do not understand that uber is just means of moving . And they should not demand super service for money that match the bus fare, Remove rating system. I don't know why passengers expect more than a safe clean and comfortable ride from point to point . I shouldn't get a low rating because the passenger wasn't entertained as well.
﻿Cutting-edge. Fast-moving. Challenging. Fulfilling., 1. Great team culture. Everyone has a larger goal to work toward. 2. You get to work with the best tools. The team internally always strives to use the best tools and techniques available to solve their problems while keeping the larger goal in the center. 3. Compensation is great. Besides the money they pay you perks like Uber credits free food and snacks reimbursement for gym and corporate phone - all these add..., Because Uber is expanding so fast sometimes global teams work in a disjoint manner, 
﻿Love working for Uber, I always feel like a valued employee my voice is heard and my opinion/feedback is sought after. I enjoy working for the company and therefore I'm proud to say where I work when I'm asked., Uber is known worldwide and a lot of people have personal views that they feel they want to share with you even though they may have never used or dealt with Uber as a company before., 
﻿Good Opportunity to learn, Good opportunity to work on ground Driven People, Long working hours and no work life balance in high pressure teams, none
﻿Good for part time, You do it on your own time. Most passages are great. Surges make you good money., Not enough pay per mile, Look into paying the drivers more per mile. At the end of the day they run the business.
﻿uber eats bike delivery dude, work when you want pays decently well if you ride really fast., you have to ride as fast as you can to make more than $20 an hour if you're slow you might not break min wage you have to file your own taxes at end of year, 
﻿Uber is a scam, Nothing-weekly pay of the table scraps you get, Horrible scam company. False advertising "$35/HR" Yo u barely will make $10/HR on most days and this doesn't include expenses gas maintenance time waters for customers cleaning supplies air freshners etc (and all of this is required otherwise your rating will be less than five stars and you will be terminated). This is the biggest deception of the century. Uber takes advantage of its labor worse than Foxconn and..., Get your robot cars on the road and fire all the drivers NOW. Zero severance pay and don't even pay them for their wages that week you get rid of them. You hate your drivers so much just get it all done. Tired of seeing poor humans slaving away at your empire. Make robots do it instead.
﻿Best place to learn, Maximum learning Helps you to enhance your multitasking abilities Gives you an opportunity to lead a team and become a leader. You will definitely gain a lot of confidence after spending atleast 6 months there., Not a very formal organisation., Be a bit more formal in terms of giving certificates bidding farewells welcoming new people and training them. Be cool as you are !!
﻿Low Pay, Flexible hours. Good for quick cash, The money is just not there. Uber has been controlling surge pricing too much. Only good for some quick cash and part time., Increase the pay.
﻿Worst company. no point of support and liar as well., nothing at the moment i can think., always got wrong commitments customers are not happy because of their poor support and service due to that drivers are not working properly. all support teams looks like illiterate and liar., management doesn't care about this.
﻿Rip Off!, There are no pros only cons., 35% off every delivery and 25% cut off every drive. This place is only in it for themselves and it’s a total scam they have to work for yourself. You work for them making little pay each day as they get a high percentage of the deal. Don’t bother when there are other companies who offer lower service fee deductions., Lower your service fees and make it mandatory for people to tip. So many people don’t tip and when you receive such low pay already it’s important they do so.
﻿My Privacy Was Violated, No idea. I didn't get that far with them because I was reluctant to send my personal information over the internet without first speaking with a real live Uber representative to ensure that I was in fact dealing with an official Uber contact. Items such as Driver's Licenses and Social Security cards etc. are sensitive items to be just handing over when you can't confirm the recipient., There is no way to contact an Uber representative by phone. The numbers I found for them had automated messages that then hang up on the caller. My last straw was today when I received a text from a former friend who apparently drives for Uber...She is now anxious for me to complete my signup with them because Uber will pay her a referral fee for my signing up! Even though I never told her and was not referred by her...., Do not disclose employee info or business to your other employees and do not automatically just set up a referral if the new person signing up to drive with you did not tell you that they were referred by someone. What I am doing professionally is no longer your other driver's business! And she should not make money off of my choice to work with Uber. If you are going to operate in this fashion you need a telephone...
﻿Good to try if you get a car, flexible hours that you want to work, decrease payments year by year, pay more to the driver
﻿Brand Ambassador Manager, Fellow employees include some of the most driven and innovative thinkers out there. I'm constantly inspired by my colleagues., Hard to transition from contractor to full-time position. Not always easy to get new ideas heard or acted upon as there seems to be constant "reorg"-ing which can cause certain creative initiatives to fall flat or reprioritized., Listen to contractors working in smaller markets or directly with drivers. They often have a much better sense of the pulse on the ground and usually have great ideas for what will improve rider and driver happiness.
﻿DO NOT DRIVE FOR UBER OR DEAL WITH XCHANGE (CLOSED), NO PROS NO PROS NO PROS, XCHANGE LEASING terrible customer service they talk to you like you're a moron and tell you contradicting things and then when you question it to try and understand it better they transfer you to a never ending HOLD!!!!!!!!!!! Im trying to return my car and he tells me to take off the license plates to return them to the dmv but i said theyre in your name not mine then says ok you can leave them but then says ok..., read a business how-to book before you start a business maybe
﻿Barely worth the effort, Total flexibility of schedule.... that's it., Considering rate of pay and expenses I doubt the average Uber Eats driver makes minimum wage., I work a VERY active area and should make a decent wage. However after calculating the rate of pay vs. expenses you make less than minimum wage doing this work. As soon as something better off comes along I'm gone. Also tell customers to give complete delivery instructions in their order like an apt number and code entry to buildings to save time. And of course remind them they can tip once in a while.... they're...

﻿Reset, The company moves fast even in the face of many obstacles. Most of my colleagues were smart motivated and ambitious, Security org was entirely poorly managed and mired in lawsuits definitely an "old boys club" as almost all higher level positions within the org were held by the CSO's friends. Promotions were exclusive to that group as well. Major gender and minority pay/equity grant disparities that the company finally attempted to level in 2017., In Security in order to change the culture and make the org functional and inclusive consider removal of remaining managers appointed by the now-fired CSO. Read all HR complaints filed against managers within the org. There are many.
﻿Dont do it with newer cars! Get an old cheap 2001 car and do it, Good pay SOMETIMES* but you end up in the middle of nowhere, Bad for your car. Messed up doors carpet paint etc, Drive passegers
﻿Uber, Meeting interesting people around town., Lower than minimum wage after expenses., Pay you drivers more. A lot more.

﻿Hardware Intern, meaningful projects great mentors good company resources, high expectations (if thats con?),

Tolls are your responsibility. Hard to find parking when doing drop offs. Sometimes you have drop offs in shady areas and you don’t feel safe. I can’t fathom how someone would stay with this company. Don’t waste your time. You’ll make..., 
﻿Pocket change if they tip, Enjoy meeting a broad spectrum of fascinating PAX, When Uber began they were paying drivers over $2 per mile (Government says it costs .54 per mile to operate a car). Because they've never turned a profit on their business model they've needed to bring their costs down. So they did this on the drivers' backs. Drivers currently earn about .74 per mile down from over $2 since 2011. This means that drivers have to fund their expenses on the 20 cent per mile spread that..., Your drivers are the first face of your company that your ridership sees. Good business and marketing judgment would dictate that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to turn riders into repeat customers via good driver experiences.

The last time I drove I picked up a woman who said she was late for her train pls. hurry along which I did. We only had a few minutes. It was..., Better bidness model. Probably not going to be able to get away with this “We’re a software co. not a transport co.” bs much longer. Not easy I know.
﻿Driver, Riders are more important to Uber than Drivers. Don't expect a career with Uber. Get in and get out., protect your drivers!, 
﻿Nice start, The points I like most are related to the autonomy that is given to employees in general. It is possible to learn about the processes talk to really good people around the world and make a difference in the company., A lot of projects are running at the same time. I feel that sometimes the company should have more focus by prioritizing some of them., 
﻿Great for a side Hustle, You can chose when and if you want to work, sometimes there are too many drivers in your area and you may not make much, 
﻿Regrets to join this company, Start up style and can handle end to end projects, low pay work life not balance, 
﻿Value(less) Addition, 1) Best work environment you could ask for 2) basic travel allowance given 3) lot of perks  which can lure anyone in that case to work with UBER. 4) Healthy experience, 1) Lack of incentive to work hard 2) Poor encouragement skills 3) Stagnant growth  unless you are a Manager there 4) Forceful intervention  in few areas of work, Not all PSR are blind  you need to understand the need of the employees who are actually working and dealing with the partners on a regular basis . Trust them incentivise them  to appreciate them.
﻿Account Manager, Young and energetic atmosphere. Fun place to work everyday and you are surrounded by bright people. Catered lunch everyday. Snacks and beverages are a definite plus also access to the gym., Extremely unorganized with little to no direction. Office is extremely segmented and separated by a couple of floors. There is no current career pathing structure in place so visibility from role to role is very limited., Connect with your employees and work alongside of them to achieve monthly quarterly and yearly goals.
﻿my overall perception first 3 months, it is modeling the future, since is really young we have a lot of opportunities from the people side, 
﻿Designer, A great and comfortable place to work with people that encourages you to always work harder and push forward looking for improvements and grow., Some people have a big Ego just because we work in a Tech Company., It is important to always be clear about directions and future plans and most important is to hear to everyone around.
﻿Why, Great to supplement income as long as you are someone who 1)already has money in the bank. 2)has a car under 10 years old. 3)has internet connection anywhere on the road., Can only work if you have a "newer" car. I mean out of the 7 billion people in the world. This job literally restricts 5.9 or more billion people from being able to have an easy way to make money. Which is the worst because money is the only thing anyone gives a crap about anymore and it also seems to be the only easy way to survive. Great. Just stomp your lower class over and over. Nobody hates you. Just sayin guys...., People still drive vehicles that were made 100 years ago. Calm yourselves
﻿good money, meet people make own schedule, not enough rides too much wait time, 
﻿Truly a slime ball company, No matter how you slice it Uber is just a sleezy company. All their efforts to improve themselves are just in vain. You can put lipstick on a pig but the pig is still a pig!!! If you drive for Uber and after taking into account all your expenses you make maybe $7.00 or $8.00 an hour. To make things even more fun they are a very difficult company to deal with if issues arise. If LYFT is in your they are a easier and..., You can login at will but then again there are only certain times of the day when you will get hailed., Very Very Greedy
﻿Incompetent employees, Na for pros need help drivers, Na for cons need help drivers, Makes the process for new driver. They trying make living while employees sitting around giving inaccurate info plus three day back and forth to get process done insurance inspections. They already have it already process pass test get Car. Help people and stop informing free car two weeks when passing again in additional cost apart from$2000 fee.
﻿Beware, Work when you want. Meet interesting people. Cash out at any time., Decreasing income to be earned. Deceptive promotions., Find a way to reward excellence. Upgrade online support to the level of of support at the hubs.
﻿They don’t condone tipping. Not worth your time. Do Postmates or Shipt. The pay is way better., None. They want you to work your button for them. Giving you almost nothing. You drive your car putting all the wear and tear to give you a $3 delivery when they are making $7 per order., None. They want you to work your butt off for them. Giving you almost nothing. You drive your car putting all the wear and tear to give you a $3 delivery when they are making $7 for nothing., Quit sitting on all the money you are making and spread it to the people that are making you money.
﻿Misery and Deception, Below Minimum wage pay and no benefits. The rides you make a bit of money are the ones to the fringes of the city the problem is when you get there there are no customers so all the miles back to the center of the city are on your own. Over saturated with drivers there are times that you will never get no pings because there are so many Uber drivers around you. The wear and tear on your car is unbelievable you will..., Stop deceiving your drivers., 
﻿Uber Partner, You set your own schedule and can make as much money as you want to make if you live near a city. self paced and self driven work., depreciation on your car and you get a 1099 as opposed to a w2 so youll probably have to pay taxes at the end of the year., 
﻿Must be desperate to do this, Flexible hours as a driver., 2000 miles of wear and tear on your vehicle to net $1000 dollars. Up to 2/3rds of your driving time and mileage are not paid for (no passenger) Uber calls you a partner but you have no say in anything. Since a driver is hired as a 1099 independent contractor they pay no health insurance no upkeep on your vehicle no benefits of any kind. After 90 fairs and after the gas I purchased was factored in I am averaging..., Cudos. You set up a great scam where instead of investing in health insurance cars and auto insurance like a taxi company you get gullible desperate people (your "partner drivers") to incur all of those cost for you.
﻿Great company!!, The opportunities here are endless. We are just beginning to tap into transportation! Come work here!, No cons working at Uber., 
﻿Software Engineer II, My opinion is taken seriously even as a newbie. Lots of new technology. Relaxed environment. Not micromanaged. Many open source projects., Sometimes feel a bit lost with all the technologies. Many teams assign us bug reports without adequate information., Better documentation. Have a roadmap that engineers can really get involved with.
﻿Uber ATG - Pittsburgh, - Some of the best and brightest people I've ever encountered work here and the majority of them are team players. Office drama politics etc. are kept to a minimum.

We have a lot of wiggle room in scheduling which really helps if you work best during a particular..., -The biggest frustration I'm running into is that they prefer to hire on a temporary or contract basis prior to extending a fulltime offer. I'm on contract and it is made crystal clear to me in multiple ways that I'm not a "real" part of the team. On multiple occasions I've been asked to attend meetings but then taken off the list when they realized I'm a contractor. Company announcements relevant to the project I'm..., -Continue the focused driven culture. -Keep investing in this exciting and market-disrupting project. Pittsburgh is the perfect venue for it. - Contractors are a part of the team. Talk to them accordingly.
﻿Good Company, working your own hours and for yourself, The long Hours to make some money in the end and tax time, 
﻿Good for a fast paced stint but not for the long term, Exciting and fast paced work. Lots of challenging problems to solve., Lack of proper HR structure. Extremely flat teams in a large set up leads to chaos and lack of proper career path for the employees., 
﻿Community Specialist, My association with Uber has been great they has an open and great working culture open to new ideas and make the employee feel comfortable. The environment is competitive and challenging and lot of hustling goes around each day., 1. Micromanaging which sometimes feels very suffocating 2. Too frequent change in working policies, Try and manage the employees more creatively.
﻿Garbage, Nothing really. I guess being able to have your schedule but there’s much better jobs you can do with flexibility and actually make money., The money is minimal. Wear and tear on vehicle. Cancelled trips. It’s like $10-15 an hour when all factors are considered. Don’t quit your day job.,

﻿Good company, Good company to work for as manager, Better Salary should be proposed, 
﻿meh, Work when you want where you want if you go where the colleges are you'll get more business good when you are between jobs and live in the larger city area, Never know where you're going until you accept the fare this may have changed.

﻿Market over saturated, You can work at anytime you want, I am not getting too many requests The rides are short and and make no money No tips from customers not even when you do the Uber eats, Stop hiring so many drivers is insane ! Is not worth it driving for Uber any longer
﻿Still a great time to join and still much to do and build, Growth opps of a startup within a maturing highly relevant company in pop culture tech and more broadly society., Many roles still ambiguous and still relatively fast changes. 2017 has featured uptick in attrition in senior levels and pockets of company; was close to zero (voluntary) in years prior owing to valuation increase. (As you can probably read about in a news search.) Controversial in most parts of the world and polarizing in certain circles of people and areas., Continue our track record of positive change this year while being cognizant that we still have a lot going for us despite media perception and month-to-month setbacks which have dogged headlines this year.
﻿Driver, Flexible hours and weekly pay., High ROI only achievable with prime hour driving i.e. 12-4 AM, Add tip option with 0% service fee to increase revenue for drivers.
﻿Long hours for decent pay., Flexible schedule with decent pay at peak times. Option to get paid daily is a nice addition. They now accept tips from riders too., Very unpredictable work. Too many other drivers out there. No ability to speak with a live representative when needing assistance. Everything is done by email., Cap the number of drivers and provide higher pay.
﻿Uber Eats owe me money, It is only Pro if you get to the restaurant and they have the order ready and you pick it up right away and you're on your way and deliver it right away. But that hardly happens., The truth behind ubereats in Houston area is that you will make minimum wage and not even $10 per hour with ubereats because if you consider the amount of time the restaurant makes you wait and the amount of time customer makes you wait and then of course you don't get any tabs and 1 out of almost 7 customers on an average will give you a tip off couple dollars so if you calculate then you will make under $10 which does..., You guys need to make tons of improvements and please pay us drivers because we drive for you even in the middle of the night and go long distances to pick deliveries and we do not get paid if the restaurant takes forever to give us the food to deliver. Also McDonald is a big issue because they do not serve full lunch menu at McDonald's at most locations at night.
﻿Good Overall Internship Experience, - Flexibility on location and team placement - Highly competent teams - People care about their mission, - The cafeteria can do better - Unstable management, 
﻿Nothing to see here - another negative Uber review., Some very talented people as co-workers who tend to go on to better and bigger things afterwards., Everything you read about Uber is true the worst aspects of tech bro culture removing Travis hasn't changed much., I have no idea how to solve the mess that is Uber.
﻿Horrible place to work, The health/dental/vision benefits are good. Uber credits are a plus., Too many overnight operational changes Experts (on the frontlines) receive information on these changes too last minute with barely any explanation or instructions on how to deliver these changes. Upper management/operations unfortunately like to hide behind their computers and expect the underpaid Experts to take all the heat. Management does not care about employees too cheap to spend on things that miiight make for..., Get on the floor more often listen to your employees listen to your DRIVERS and cut the divide between Experts and Management/Operations.
﻿Driver, Travel to places and talk to friendly people sometimes, Really big cons is they take a 25 percent cut and they do nothing while you always drive. Really hate that and also there fare for drivers is so small you wont make a penny, Take your cut off
﻿Account Manager in Dallas, Amazing Co-Working Space Occasional Happy Hour Money isn't too bad either, Managment The company itself Drama Gotta be a "cool kid" to move up Most people have an above average IQ, Quit your job
﻿Great experience, * Strong team * Innovative environment * Challenging tasks * Great culture, * Not public yet * No onsite chefs :), 
﻿Fantastic company for motivated and smart individuals looking to make a difference and be rewarded for delivery, Fast pace - quick decisions quick implementation intelligent and motivated colleagues. New challenges - new markets and new transportation models have different needs so no day is the same. Also creating new industries that require new solutions. Flexible working styles : hours dress code food office layout -all of these are flexible and adapt to preferences of the team to get the best out of everyone. ..., Pace and pressure generate high workloads - not for those looking for a 9-5 easy job. Still facing into a number of issues/scandals giving negative press/external perception. Growing rapidly - some of the controls and processes are catching up to the scale of the biz today., Keep pushing the new culture - more mature and responsible culture that keeps the energy and passion of the startup.

﻿Not worth the effort, Pick your own availability. You get to move around and not just sit in the car all day., You drive to the pickup location but that mileage doesn't get paid out. Sometimes I would drive 10 miles to pick up from restaurant and then you drive a mile to the drop off and get paid $3.20. I did 19 drop offs in 8 hours (waiting for food driving to pickups) and made $80 $16 in tips (from 3 of them btw most people don't tip) and put in $15 in gas. It's not even minimum wage., Fix your GPS. It's so bad. No exaggeration 70% of the time it would take me behind the restaurant and I would have to pull up Google maps to find it. Pay more.

﻿Paid holidays?, Yes you can choose not to drive any time you want., No you will not get paid for that time. And if you choose to drive there is no holiday drive pay., Offer incentives like this because it will retain quality contractors we don't make that much to begin with in addition we should make more for long distance travel when it takes us out of state.

Every day I see people using our products and can experience the outcome of my team's hardwork. The freedom you're given is also amazing. If I want to travel I can do so. If I have an idea for a project/feature/initiative I can design and get help building it. If I want to user test my designs..., Uber has a bad reputation right now and that can be tough to deal with., Keep doing what you're doing - it's painful to dig up skeletons but it's working.
﻿Operations Manager, fast past and fun environment, leasing division is closing down, n/a
﻿Current driver, Works on your own free time, Long waiting to get customer, 
﻿Fast pace lots of good teams some bad too, This is a very fast moving place. Every day things change. Mostly for the good Some teams are very good. They take pride in their work. But some teams are just warm bodies, If you are in a bad team life is hell. Things get shifted a lot and it’s a very top down management, Slow down.

﻿You will earn more money by sitting at home and collecting a government check!, You can choose which hours to work that is it! Nothing else is positive about the working conditions for the pay!, Pay that is less than half of what minimum wage is zero tips loss of dignity and self-respect massive wear and tear on your car tremendous waste of gas to travel 20 miles to deliver a meal which pays out $3! I would not recommend anyone to work for this service! I worked for 2 days and had enough. Even though I really need the money I would rather be homeless and collect cans and bottles to recycle. I would make..., Try working this job for one day and you will understand! I cannot believe anyone would work for this delivery service when there are so many others that offer much better pay and working conditions! Find a way to encourage customers to tip if you would like to keep delivery drivers. Otherwise your frugal delivery service will fail!
﻿Excellence of Uber as a Company for a current employee, Scheduled trainings and meetings Very transparent management, unclear career growth path low incentive schemes, Please improve the incentive schemes

﻿Best Technology Company, Great working environment opportunity for advancement daily catered lunch and much more., No cons best company in the valley., Please do not allow nepotism to become a trend.
﻿Too many drivers, Too many drivers on the road. Mileage high daily on vehicle. High depreciation., increase base pay., 
﻿Horrible for drivers and low low pay, none-- I can just say that if you are an uber driver do not take deliveries. They will eat up all your time and you won't be able to do uberx/ pool because of the deliveries. What's more your car smells like food when you pick up the next ride!, useless mileage on your car-- food deliveries are often 10-15 min away and we do not get paid to go there so that's dead time and dead miles annoying-- delivery and drop off are often far apart and then sometimes they ask you to go back to the same place to get another order and deliver it to another far away place. long waits at restaurants for which you are also not paid., pay drivers way more use smart routing make it worth doing-- there's a reason why people hate it and won't do it.
﻿Uber uses the drivers to make money, You can choose when do you work and thats the only advantage, They use the drivers to make money. No way to make money from it because of the expanses. Sometimes even a drunk rider may give you 1 star rating for no reason which when repeated Uber deactivate your account., 
﻿You can grow fast, I joined since very early stage.Grows super quickly. You have chances to work with the best people in league. If you are proactive and love challenges there are many opportunities to grow fast and do big-scale works., Still messy and plans change at last minutes. Some great bosses some not so great. Contractors are relatively underpaid. Work long hours., Culture values should be more concise and action-oriented (now we have more than 10)
﻿Worked as a delivery driver, You can make your own schedule Good driver app GUI Great Flexible part time job only for drivers and you can pick and choose your hours., You won’t get Minimum wage after gas and wear and tear.As per my exp you make $5-$6 per hour after your gas expenses. Poor Uber maps., Increase pay
﻿Despite Setbacks Uber will continue to succeed at this pace, Smart colleagues Future looks much better with Dara Real-time impact with your work Management and leadership always improving Work-life balance Good comp relative to other companies Free food/snacks, Uber attracts a lot of young talent but not all of them are cut out to work 110%, 
﻿Very lucky to work at Uber, - Brilliant & entrepreneurial people across the company - Very challenging real-world problems - Great office culture & perks (speakers activities food games etc.), - Reality vs. media perception of vision or tactics do not always align, Use larger centrally-run campaigns to tell the incredibly positive stories (e.g. driver stories) better!
﻿A wonderful company to work for, onboarding experience employee quality company's vision and mission leadership and commitment, due to all the hiring efforts at time process within various departments on cross-function projects can be a little disorganized, 
﻿Can't be happier!, Managers are super nice and supportive. Team members are smart and helpful. (Maybe depends on what team) Friendly culture. Great benefit., Cannot think of any... maybe food can be better., 
﻿It’s on, You can make good money if you plan, They’ll cut you off for anything, 
﻿Driver Beware, Work only when you want to., In short uber tries to manipulate drivers with hard to achieve incentives in order to get drivers to work at certain times and places., Stop taking advantage of drivers.
﻿Operations Manager, Open and transparent culture employees feel like owners and are very engaged super fast learning exposure to leadership autonomy, Still structuring some processes high workload, Keep team engaged and with this ownership attachment
﻿Operation and Logistic Manager, A lifetime experience! It's a great place to contribute globally based on local experience., For some corporate people we are not the usual way to do business, 
﻿Great company!, Working alongside very smart people strong on-boarding/training and ownership of projects from day one. Real opportunity to make an impact., Nothing to mention so far, 
﻿Driver cut, , , 
﻿A Start-Up Culture in A Big Corporation, • Colleagues are like friends ownership in projects dynamic workplace and constant innovations, • Several things going on you really need time management, • 5 to 7 is ideal team size
﻿Trying to grow, The Instant pay is great honestly., When the work flow is slow you ultimately end up wasting your time and gas., If you would some how feel that it would be right for you jus make sure you love driving.
﻿Not worth your time, instant cash and great if you're uber XL, they could care less if you're driving for them. wear and tear on your car and not enough cash coming in to compensate for wear and tea r. Misleading at peak times such as New years eve. Hinting at money to be made and then you can't even come close. They could care less of who you are in real life and only look at cold impersonal info .. no forgiveness, get out of the box.
﻿Very pleasant internship experience!, My mentor is very hands on to my project so I learned a lot from him Team members are very nice and helpful Interesting project with big potential impact Flexible hours; good work-life balance Good culture, Dinner not provided in Palo Alto office, Keep up! I have faith in Uber!
﻿A big company that's still figuring out how to be a big company, Really intelligent motivated people with serious challenges and a real chance to make an impact., A company whose internal processes aren't fully structured. I work in Marketing and there is still no CMO and no clear vertical marketing organization across the globe. 400 people work in marketing at HQ and even THEY don't know who does what so there's a lot of efficiency to be gained in streamlining processes orga and teams., Trust the talent you hire and be very clear on how you expect them to contribute in the balance between strategic vision and operational work. I was hired in a role that stretches me to the limits of both and when stretched that far my contribution at either end becomes less effective.
﻿Great Place to Work, The teams are so close- it feels like a family free high-end food and snacks good salary great benefits (gym allowance health insurance) great progression opportunities one-to-one meetings with managers regularly to review progress and set goals for your future in the company., Long hours and unsociable shift patterns but you get your rota 8 weeks in advance so you can plan around this., Keep doing what you're doing!
﻿Decent source of extra cash., If you are driven you can make easy money., If you do not like to work hard this may not be for you., none
﻿Policy and government relations, Content of the work is interesting and challenging. A lot of smart people. Nice offices all around the world. Internal mobility., A lot of turf wars and poor behavior. The environment is challenging for women a lot of dismissals and some politicking., Be transparent and promote internally rather than hiring outside.
﻿Customer and Community Support, Good Benefits. Promotion opportunities and a fast paced environment, Transparency and Management issues. Process sometimes is not realistic., 
﻿Learning all the time, Fast paced with brilliant colleagues. Uber is a please where you can make a direct impact on a product you likely use every day. It is a great feeling knowing that you are contributing to independence for so many drivers and riders., It is hard not to get whiplash at times. Decisions with get made reversed and then made again. There is a good bit of growing up for middle management. The top level managers are starting to set that course and over the next year things should solid up., 
﻿Ubereats, Jan. 2018 It now pays way below Ontario minimum wage. Not worth it delivering on high rise condos or apt. Bldgs. Navigation is horrible., Min. Wage update. Extra fee in time spent finding a parking space and going up to 25th floor & higher., 
﻿Exceptional Company, High energy Focus on speed Exciting High impact, Sometimes people will assume negative things about Uber employees because of the bad press., Keep doing what you're doing. I really appreciate that Uber is focused on doing the right thing and I'm looking forward to the company reaping the rewards on the turn around initiatives.
﻿Drive for Uber early morning until noon daily, Choose your own hours. Meet some very interesting people. Opportunity to help people who really need a ride and have no other alternative., Pay could be better. The Uber navigation APP is horrible. Very unreliable. Why Uber doesn’t utilize Waze or a better Nav platform is a mystery. Driver rating system still has issues. No local help - every time you contact support you teach someone in the Philippines. Every once in awhile you get to ride with an idiot. Most riders do not tip., Improve your navigation app. Offer bonuses. Increase pay across the board for all drivers. Give riders several tip options - 15% 20% 30% etc.
﻿Don't unless you have to, Flexible schedule. Can go online or offline any time you feel like it., The only information you are given when a ride request comes in is how far way that rider is from you in minutes. That is all you get in the few seconds you have to accept the ride. You have no clue about destination until you pick the rider up. Could be just across town or it could be significantly farther than you want to go or have time to go. And uber doesn't give a damn how that affects you. Also it appears that..., Give the driver at least a tiny bit of info rather than forcing them to play Russian roulette with every ride request. And please only hire support people who can actually read and comprehend what they read or whaat they hear if phone support. Or just dont offer support at all. That would actually be an improvement compared to what you offer now. And quit calling us partners. You clearly don't think of drivers as that....

﻿its ok, time managerment is a good chhose own shcuedule, bad pay. they take a huge cut, better pay to driers. need to take less vut and charge for longer rides and help with car maintenncae
﻿Ok for a sidegig, You can work at anytime you like., 1. Company won't allow you to be tipped from their platform. 2. Wear on your car that you more than likely will not be able to afford to repair based on what you make after Uber's 25% to 30% cut insurance and gas., At the very least allow tips and if not you could lower your cut of monies made so that your drivers can keep their cars repaired
﻿Best Company ever, Best workplace to learn !, Contractual employees can have problems with their salary, Nothing
﻿Feedback, working environment perks and benefits schedule flexibility transparency from the upper management, Payroll issues the need to manually file holiday pays and etc manually HR processes, Team building :)
﻿Great People Interesting Work, From day one I have been tasked with an array of interesting challenges and compelling projects. The company is still in its infancy and there are so many ways to contribute to its future. Additionally the provided trainings and courses for career development are fantastic., Because the company is fairly new there is not always a clear process and often the ability to knowledge share between groups is difficult., I truly believe that if we stick to our cultural values we will continue to be successful. Never deviate from them and make sure they are well known by our employees.
﻿Operations and Logistics Manager, Great environment well paid great coworkers, None so far. 3 months now, 
﻿Operations and Logistics Manager, You work with very talented and smart people and work with a product that affects millions of people across the globe., Salary and bonus is below industry average., 
﻿Hard work pays off, Really fast growth if you are willing to go the extra mile, Rotational shifts and offs with not enough leave days, 
﻿Business Analyst Intern, Location was Beijing China. Very early stage of Uber in China. Team's pretty small and united. Pretty beneficial for students; lots of takeaways at the end., Intense with a heavy workload. Interns worked in the same way as full-time. There were only 3 "Managers". Everything started from scratch. I was asked to perform both quantitive analysis & marketing analysis and online/digital marketing. Sometimes helped with branding & product management., Not really. It's well known as Uber's style in China. Different branches operated independently. I guess means to improve management is to inform applicants that they are expected to work 9am-9pm/10pm with several short breaks in between; they will learn a lot but it can be pretty intensive and stressful.
﻿Freedom, Free to work whatever days I chose and whatever hours I choose it’s good fun I get to meet fun people, Pay is not always consistent you can really rack up the miles on your car for as many fun folk you can meet you’ll also meet the moody ones, 
﻿Internship at Uber, , , 
﻿Driver Beware!, None that I can see., 1. Ubereats takes 35% service fee for each fare you complete. 2. "Boost" locations are not clearly given on their app website or emails. These sources give you the name of the city not the exact locations or restaurants. 3. Uber support folks are easily confused and completely incompetent. In 2 days I made 16 pickups and 16 drops offs and made approx $70 after all their service fees. Not to mention the gas..., Take away the service fees. Clearly put the exact boost locations on your app website and emails. Reimburse drivers for metered parking in all cites. Hire competent support staff.
﻿Great for Weekend Work Not for Full Time, VERY Flexible Instant Pay feature Easy to start Can make a decent amount on specific holidays, Use own vehicle and its REALLY rough on you car. Hard to make consistent trips. Waiting system can be unbalanced Higher Insurance payments. Cost to Pay ratio is over exaggerated., 
﻿For an intern not as bad as media portrays it, -Engaging work -Free Food -Prime social location (SF) -Mentor was really cool, -Although not as bad as you think morale of company was low when i was there, Already done with internship and a new CEO was announced. Keep listening to your employees and engage with them to solve workplace issues. Improve HR department
﻿Working at Uber, Efficient processes and people inspire you to strive for more and think out of the box. Good compensation and benefits Promotes a culture of work-life integration, Benefits can be improved to be more family-oriented, 
﻿Success Is purely based on area, Work your own hours. Job is fairly easy and stress free. Pay is potentially higher than a conventional delivery driver. Good gig for young teens or college students with crazy schedules., You are required to live in a large city in order to get enough orders. Uber commission is high. Restaurants rarely follow the rules of the service and make drivers look bad to the customers. Absolutely zero compensation for vehicle usage., 
﻿Operations Manager, Fast-growing fast moving High impact No time to get bored, Long hours Inaccurate public perception, 
﻿So far So good, A lot of freedom to learn, Company struggling to operate as a large company, 
﻿I have been working with Uber less than a year, Flexibility Instant pay Work on your own schedule, low mileage pay using your own car, increase mileage pay
﻿Great company, , , 
﻿Deiver, None I don’t see any good, Uber is a terrible company to work for since they hold your income at any time for any stupid thing that the Rider or food orders tell them as a excuse to not pay for some service; Uber always blame the driver doesn’t matter how good you have being serving the community they always blend the driver!, Bad
﻿Meh, Lots of ride on the weekends. Weekly and weekend bonuses., -wear and tear on your car -not paid enough on average -long waits between rides -very hit and miss - not paid for trips that take you out of your area, 
﻿To Uber or not?, You can set your own hours., Not enough pay after gas and wear and tear of your car., Pay more
﻿Reconsider your Full-Time Offer, Uber is currently investing a lot in current employees with access to job training and employee education. Free snacks and lunch. Office is based on San Francisco., It has to provide access to job training because many individuals do not know how to do their jobs. There are many folks who have been with the company for years and classic startup have been promoted to management roles without spending the time actually getting the necessary experience. There are many managers who are first time managers. This leads to chaos a lack of organization and inability to take action on..., Get reorgs over with so people can start building together. Get rid of middle managers because many are not qualified to be building out teams and hiring more people.
﻿Technician, Cutting edge technology great benefits awesome perks great management!, My experience has been way better than what you hear in the news., Keep up the good work!
﻿Operations Coordinator, , , 
﻿ATG Upper Management is Woefully Out of Touch with Day-to-Day Operations, Excellent Health/Dental/Vision coverage. Free meals. Unlimited PTO before it was cut. Interesting technology., - Recruiters are frustratingly inept and lied about job title - Upper management has made several sweeping changes without having a throughout (or even slight) understanding of day-to-day operations. - Recent organizational changes have resulted in a reduction of hours benefits and responsibilities for those in my role. The job I was hired to do is now being pitched as a promotion to my current role effectively..., Take more time to talk to the teams your decisions will affect and get an understanding of how things are run. When you do talk to those teams do it with purpose rather than just for show. Those of us in Phoenix are treated like numbers rather than people. Fix this. Uber went through the effort of hiring many very capable (and often over-qualified) people for a Test team. That team has been treated very unfairly and...
﻿Rating System - Needs improvements, You are the boss. You get on the road when you feel like it. Nobody is on top of you saying are you done yet?, Poort grading/rating system (Feedback). Poor communication from management. Only templates in response to your concern. They never actually respond to you they just do a copy and paste of a template they currently have ., I would highly recommend make major changes to the rating system. It is not fair where a customer who has been drinking and wasted take a ride and give you bad review because they are under influence. Why not have a anonymous feedback system so drivers can improve their service. I do not understand the policies put in place. Why have your employees copy and paste rather than saying we will take this to upper management...
﻿Terrible experience, Take the money when you make the money, Need to drive many miles to make good wage Incentives are given and once attained are twice as hard for same amounts of money for next incentive, Pay the drivers more or take less of fee
﻿UberEats could be worse, Don't have to drive drunk people around., Have to interface with three different entities: Uber + Restaurant + Client. Wait can be ridiculous at night especially at McDonalds. Pay is not worth it. should get paid for how long away the restaurant is., Switch up McDonalds' Ping handling instructions. Many times I declined/cancelled orders because i knew it would take 30 minutes of waiting after the ping came through.
﻿Driver, Great company to work for, Having to pay do self-employment taxes, Doing a good job
﻿Zero Respect for Contract Workers, The only pro to this job is learning experience., Let's start with lack of management. At the beginning of 2017 the onboarding team for Dallas was left with NO MANAGEMENT and 2 (yes 2) onboarders for the entire city of Dallas. For months we begged to have a new hire to help us out because we were swamped all the time. It took 4 months for them to hire someone that lasted 1 month. By the time we got help (it took until November) the back log of restaurants waiting to..., Get your stuff together. How do you honestly expect to run a company when 100% of your employees hate their jobs? How about appreciating people and commending them for their work? How about lending a hand when they need help? How about HIRING MORE PEOPLE SO THE WORK LOAD ISNT SO HEAVY? How about literally just giving a crap about your employees? Or how about just being around to help out? I can't tell you how many times...
﻿New Grad SWE at Uber, I joined Uber right after graduating form university and so far I think it's an awesome place to start a career. I'm often surprised by the responsibility and autonomy that I have as a New Grad. I love that I always feel like I don't know enough as that's constantly pushed me to learn more things more quickly and I can definitely see how this has helped me grow faster than my friends who graduated at the same time., Uber's a really controversial company and while we know internally that we try to do the right thing the world often doesn't see it that way. It can be really exhausting to constantly see your company portrayed negatively in the media. It also becomes a bit exhausting to explain the situation to your friends and family. This exhaustion can sometimes be felt at the office. Additionally while Uber's tried quite hard..., Uber prides itself on feeling like a small company while still being a large company. It would be really cool if we could redouble this effort.
﻿Uber has its ups and downs but it's a behemoth of a company to work for., ~ Weekly pay 💲 ~ Instant pay 💸 ~ Built-in navigation 🗺 ~ Flexibility🔃 ~ Support 📞 ~ Ubiquitous 🌎, ~ Use your own 🚗 ~ Navigation could be better 🗺 ~ Ubiquitous 🌎 ~ No scheduled structure ⏰, Get more personal with the driver partners. They are the backbone of the company.
﻿It's basically a loan-scheme against the value of the car you've already paid for, It's good if you have a car on lease that has extra milage leased before you're supposed to turn it in., It's basically a loan-scheme against the value of the car you've already paid for., Be upfront with people about what Uber actually is and the money they could actually make.
﻿Does Care About Employees and Discriminates, Nothing... Since they do not care about the employees and have no real management., Discriminated against my disability and didn't even apologize for their ignorance. A rider accused of doing drugs and when I agreed to take a test they refused. Told them I was highly allergic to perfumes colognes and smoke and I asked them to tell the client and they refused. Worst company ever!!!, Get some real managers!
﻿Beware of vindictive and horrible managers in ATG, * Cool tech * Most employees are pretty cool and smart * Learn cool stuff, * You may end up with a complete sociopath for a manager someone who is managing a large team before learning to manage a single person someone leading a team of engineers who doesn't have engineering chops. * Hard to change teams If you are lucky and don't get a psycho manager then it's gonna be great. If you end up with a bad manager your life could be hell., Need to force accountability on managers who focus on managing up only and don't effectively manage their teams. There are good people at Uber who are truly suffering as a result.
﻿Won’t recommend unless your desperate for cash, Work whenever you want as little or as much as you want., Not always a fair amount of money for your time. A lot of people do not tip., Should offer regular hourly guarantee.
﻿Be fast and never get bored, Awesome super prepared and unimaginably smart people very dynamic work., You have to be careful with the worklife balance., 
﻿DA team, , , 
﻿Was an intern at Uber, Good work-life balance good projects and have a big impact on the production., didn't get return offer leadership have big change during my internship, keep trying
﻿Not for everyone, flexible work hours almost immediate compensation meeting a lot of new and interesting people, having to deal with rude or careless customer behavior can be stressful driving in the city all day too many deductions and fees that company gets to keep, Great app and easy to start gettig paid fro driving. But I wish company shared some more wealth with its most hard working workforce

﻿Manuiplative Exploitive Company, Flexible schedule chose your hours, Uber has been flooding the market with WAY WAY WAY too many drivers. They are trying to defeat Lyft. With so many drivers Uber thinks more riders will use them since they can cover calls quicker. That just causes way too much competition for the business that is there. Then they lower their rates to be less than Lyft. Both of these tactics are built on the backs of the drivers. I have been a top Uber driver for..., F yourselves!

Great payment, When a fraud customer complain they deactivate your account for too long more than 1 month so I advise you to have a camera in your car to protect your self from a liar customer., Do nit believe liar customers add security cameras in Uber cars mandatory.
﻿Vehicle operator, Benefits are good and that’s about it at this point. A lot of changes made it a bad place to work., The new internal mobility program prohibits people from opportunities to grow their careers at Uber. Level 1 and only move up one level. Recruiting doesn’t care about internal transfers. No feedback is given. Poor leadership at times. Poor communication., Give people a chance to develop their careers. The levels don’t allow people to move into roles which they are fit for. Also recruiting doesn’t care much about internal transfers which is shown by the way we are treated during the process.

﻿Good product poor leadership and low transparency, 1) Uber is without doubt a great product. 2) Furthermore its fast pace environment isn't rivaled in terms of speed by many companies. 3) Additionally some colleagues (notably at GM level) were among the smartest and most interesting people I ever worked with. Uber's extreme growth over the past years poses however also several challenges (see below), Overall Uber was a mixed experience and in the hindsight I regret joining them. The main reason being the very negative corporate culture and the poor people management skills of its top management. 1) Uber is severely understaffed and desperately tries to get people in all areas - and it notably lacks good leaders. Traditionally Uber promotes purely based on operational results. Unfortunately the best managers aren't..., 1) Higher focus on recruiting good people managers. 2) Completely revamp the feedback process. 3) Develop a way how to integrate external managers (otherwise Uber is just spending a lot of money on recruitment and then burning its talent super fast.

﻿Uber, Great hours sometimes meet great people great to talk to., Sometimes lack of work sometimes meet crappy people with bad attitudes, 
﻿Great company not so great role, Working with the smartest people in the tech industry, No career pathing for this role, 
﻿Community Support Representative, Benefits forward thinking company willing to listen has a career path for self driven individuals compensation is good and there is recognition and internal opportunities for those who put in the work., At times communication lacks - really depends on your direct supervisor. At this time there is no pay for performance bonus models for high achievers., Keep moving forward!

﻿Patner, Owner Boss Workable Goals Living, Surge times taxes rental company, Stop with the Rental Programs they are not worth it to the person tryign to start fresh
﻿Used to be great. Things have changed for the worse., Work on your time by choice. Meet new people visit new places, Oh where to start. Uber used to be a lucrative side or main gig. Now its only good if you're 100% full time or only work holidays for side money. If this were 2+ years ago my view would be completely different. - Oversaturation: This is the end goal of uber. Everyone is a driver. The downside to this is there are too many cooks in the kitchen at once. - Lack of freedom or choice. Uber wants you to be obediant as..., Change the culture of uber respect your EMPLOYEES more.
﻿Uber is the Devil, Flexible Schedule. You can drive any time., You get to drive you business into the ground....literally. Your car only lasts so long depreciates etc. What you make does not cover the value of your car gas upkeep and taxes. ~20% of your customers are crazy depending on where you live. Management deactivated my account after a customer complaint and then reactivated my account after an investigation. Then I gave one ride they deactivated my account and said..., Don't be buttheads.
﻿Below average, -wont deliver mc nuggets unless you currently live inside the Mc Donald's., make sure you deliver to everyone :), 
﻿Great place to work for if you value autonomy and doing interesting work under pressure, - Stimulating work - High intensity - Autonomy, - Stress - Strict work culture, 
﻿Decent, work when you want to, hard to contact the company, open more lines of communication
﻿Hey it's Uber, It is great for people who are down to drive for a very long time for many many miles. You cannot be fired for being sick. You get to meet beautiful people. You become a better driver. You get to learn about a city in an interesting way. Solitude., Doing the job requires driving for a very long time for many miles. Spine problems. Shoulder problems. Neck issues. Venous problems. Indigestion. Solitude., I do not have much to say. This works pretty well for the people that are attracted to it. Thank you for giving me and other people this opportunity for interesting work.
﻿Impactful work great learning, Grow your strategic and operational skills working for one of the world's fastest growing companies. Learn from and collaborate with inspiring coworkers., Be prepared to enjoy your work AND to work hard. Hours are long sometimes but it's worth it., 
﻿General Manager, - Closest thing there is to running your own company - making a real difference in the world on people's lives - city teams given a high level of autonomy and freedom to run their markets - very smart passionate co-workers that care about making a positive difference in the world - culture is changing to be more inclusive fair and transparent - investment in learning & development in courses such as the Harvard Business..., - high level of stress driven by high level of uncertainty - too much press coverage on every detail can get draining - long working hours - always on mentality as something could go wrong at any minute - it's a 24/7 business - career paths not super clear - you will need to be comfortable with uncertainty and actively pursue what you want within the company, 
﻿Data Analyst, It is free to let you do what you could do, The working environment is not good, 
﻿Don't even bother, No pros at all. None!, The pay is already low and they have the nerve to only pay mileage from the point of pick up to the customer. Nevermind the fact that most times you are driving 5+ miles just to get to the restaurant but you will not be paid for that. Pay starts AFTER you pick up the order. Customers dont tip and restaurants take too long to make the food. You will be lucky to make gas money back. Don't waist your time!, Your company makes enough money to pay drivers properly. Penny pinching your drivers is not ok because if it weren't for us you would not have a business! Take better care of your "delivery partners" and maybe you will have more drivers.
﻿Re-imbursement Issues, 2min. MAX wait before charged a "no show" fee has cost me far more than it has been worth this service unfortunately., exceed the 2min. required wait time for drivers so that clients do get stranded in cold weather waiting for another car AND getting charged a "no show" fee for it., 
﻿uber driver, You can make your own schedule and control over employment. Relaxed work environment. Hassle free opportunities. Independent of others. Individual results based salary., Customers can be rude sexist and be demanding of your abilities as a driver. Very little compensation for damages to the vehicle as a result of customers. Cost of employment and cost of basic upkeep for a vehicle are not proportioned. Not effective as a full-time job., Create better compensation packages for drivers. Limit rude customers with low scores.
﻿Operations expert - uber, Less working hours. Good pay., Hectic at sometimes.

﻿Uber is turning a corner, A place where everything you do has an impact on a grand scale and where you are fully empowered to own success for yourself & the business., The pace is insanely fast & the amount that gets done in any given day/week/month is huge. 1 Uber month = 6mos in other companies., Deliver on the new promises & priorities that we're making to employees customers partners and the world in general.
﻿Great Entry Position, Fast paced Many opportunities to learn if you are eager Great network, The company was in transition therefore people management could have been done better. Politics definitely exist so one must be strategic,

﻿UberEATS ha!, You get to set your own schedule. Great as side job, Not enough pay for a lot of work, Look at where your company stands and how much you are paying your employees. They need to be compensated better!
﻿Driving for Uber as side hustle, work at anytime you want work as long as you want, .70 cents per mile pay .11 cents per minute all this once you pick passenger up Uber does not pay for gas Gotta pay ones own taxes No benefits, 
﻿Uber Driver, -Great at making quick money at your own time -Only good for part time or busy time -Ideal job for college student, -Uber takes 45% of the total charges not just 25% -You will tear up and destroy your car if you work full time -Sometimes rude/drunk customers must exercise a lot of patience and possess alligator skin so their obscene behaviour doents get deep in you, Create more incentives for drivers and dont cheat them of their earned money
﻿uber driver, i been driving for uber for about 3 years and i know the city of san diego and that can help me to do a good job for eat24, traffic and parking can be hard sometimes, 
﻿Great, company culture free credits daily lunch unlimited vacation, compensation long hours hard to progress job opportunities mostly eng, 
﻿Office Culture, I receive a lot of support from my manager & some of my colleagues the environment is becoming more & more pleasant, Earlier on the environment seems a little colder and office event participation is very much lesser. After a few office events were set up staff bonding is at a much better level. Staff are now more eager to participate in office events being held. People now shows more trust & cooperation when a better bond is created. Work runs more smoothly., At the moment we are utilising Employee Morale budgets for all our current activities which is fine for small events. However appreciate if management can provide a separate budget for Team Building & company dinner that we can include all employees & have a proper event. Thank you.
﻿Dynamic & inspiring workplace, Expanding your network and getting to know the best of the best in this industry all around the world. Ask and you'll get help as people here are friendly. Best part of working in Uber is that we are contributing to making the world a better place to live in., As best as the company tries as a place that's growing this speed communication will tend to be the biggest problem. I sometimes feel I don't receive information as quickly as I wished I had., We should work smarter & harder in showing the world what we stand for and what we want to achieve. There's so much good behind what we are doing and it's a pity that we keep getting negative PR/media.
﻿Horrible pay is just miserable and doesn't cover the expenses, You are 100% flexible and see around, 99% of people DO NOT TIP because uber discouraged them from tipping for a very long time so now they feel entitled not to tip. You are basically draining life out of your car in order to feed yourself out of desperation. In the end your maintenance bill will overcome all the money you made working for uber. It is a total loss and the company plan is to kill tips/lower delivery cost and promote their business USING..., Pay a minimum hourly/rate for drivers who are constantly online and have high acceptance rate. Don't be so greedy.
﻿A great place to work at the forefront of technology, Vibrant technology to sustain continuous growth. The challenges and problems are good problems to have: growth growth growth! With reliability and security as top priority. Some really outstandingly smart fast and bold engineers!, There is at time redundancy/conflicting projects among teams and this can be sub-optimal., Keep-up with the vision impacting the world is such a great journey!
﻿driver, u can drive when you want, low pay for time spent driving, increase pay per mile driven
﻿Driver, There is much freedom and chatting with different people is really fun. The pay was good compared to the work. Keep track of your mileage folks! It really pays during tax time., The long sitting made my rear numb. Have a good data plan., Nice job.
﻿A mixed bag, There has been a flood of negative news during all of 2017 and while much of that is deserved there are still some positives about working at Uber. Your co-workers are typically very bright passionate and kind. IMO it's not that common where you such strong mobile devops fullstack etc everywhere. Furthermore there is a serious ongoing effort to correct many past wrongs., By and large I would say all the negative news were not that far from the truth. Additionally it often seems that leadership is lacking with management and executives., There is a real ongoing retention issue. In the past year and a half I've seen my org experience ~66% turnover.
﻿Marketing Operations Coordinator, Great office and catered lunch!, Not much room for growth or review for raise., Company culture is pretty segregated as far are Full time employees and contractors.
﻿Awesome Internship experience, Really cool projects to work Competitive pay, Internship events could have been better!, 
﻿Driver, Choose your own working hours, Poor pay hardly covers the cost of operating your own vehicle, High payer and/or more car cost saving incentives
﻿Product Manager, - Huge scope on projects (all high impact) because there are so many improvements to be made at scale across the company - I can only speak to the team I have worked on but top tier talent and professionalism among my peers. As at all companies there will be 'bad apples' but am yet to encounter them in my day to day. - It is still the early days of Uber - Uber connects the physical and digital in a way most tech..., - Salaries not as high as FB/GOOG/MSFT - Management figuring out right amount of process will take some time - Lack of clarity about Uber's true value as a company, - Let's continue to strive to become the company our cities deserve
﻿Uber/Uber Eats, - Flexible schedule - Weekly pay - Instant pay, - Use your own car - Navigation system could use some work - Can't contact customer on deliveries until after pickup, Make it easier to get in contact with support.
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Much improved, The flexibility to drive when I want and create my own schedule is wonderful! I also appreciate the incentives to earn extra income! They are really powerful and make a huge difference in my daily financial goals., None at the moment., 
﻿Ease of working with UBER, Working for myself on my own schedule was helpful to my lifestyle. People appreciated the service because they were usually to get a ride more quickly than by calling the taxi companies and get it at a better rate., Sometimes it is difficult working near colleges because if the student thinks your getting to them will take too long they will call another UBER driver so I found it better to work away from campuses for that reason and for the reason that the rides were usually short and unprofitable. Airports are another bad place to pick people up because you are usually waiting along with many other drivers in a special lot and..., Using hot spots to get drivers out to a location that needs coverage usually turns out to be a waste of time and money for the drivers because by the time the driver gets to the position it is no longer treated as a hot spot where the driver can get increased fees. This is not a good way to treat your people.
﻿Pretty satisfied, , , 
﻿Works for Me, I work when and however long or short I want., The "pay" is not excellent by any means., Think of your contractors. They "are" your business.
﻿Expert, Culture community benefits movement environment, Pay is usually below average for similar job titles but is usually outweighed by other benefits, 
﻿Professional Driver, Flexible hours enjoy meeting and interacting with people from all walks of life., Too many people doing it now not making as much money, 
﻿No work life balance long working hours. Sales operations Exec., Lunch is provided room for growth I.E a small twam to lead coach train. Free uber rides (limited but enough), Long working hours. 9-6 or 10-7 but always end around 10pm or latest 12am. No OT pay. Management will always say it's like this as uber is always hustling. They strongly believe the longer hours you work means you are capable or passionate in your job. Poor communication skills from top management to lower junior executives. No point to raise the long working hours issue as it will be ignored. They hire a lot of part..., cut short working hours be standardized. If employees go off on time they shouldn't be penalized. Hire more full timers instead for better management.
﻿Waste of time, You decide when you want to work, Not making enough money to cover living expenses and cost of your car when you consider that with all that mileage you will have to repair it. Sometimes you have to carry people that you don't want to carry like rude unkind smelly drunk dirty dangerous etc...., Stop taking advantage of people.
﻿High expectations high autonomy. Chance to change the world for the better., Fast paced very dynamic work environment. Despite tough 2017 morale is up with new CEO and unmatched opportunity to shape new changing industries. Very high levels of autonomy and trust in the team. Manager cares about me and my development., Despite growth still startup trying to do more with less. Very much a stay lean and cheerful type culture which can lead to overscoping. But you don't join Uber for the work life balance you do so to for a chance to change the way the world works for the better. We have the privilege of a real honest-to-goodness opportunity at doing that every day., Level up compensation with other public tech companies.
﻿Love working at Uber, - Exciting work environment - High impact projects - So many opportunities to learn and grow to the fast pace, - Negative press. Media will only hype up negatives and as someone that has been working at the company I have seen so much improvement., Keep going upwards and keep the positive changes to the company and culture coming.
﻿Flexible but hard to make good money, Flexible hours allowing you to work only when you want Very easy to use application Payment structure Unpaid time off, Wear and tear on personal vehicle Lackluster compensation No paid time off No health insurance Too many drivers Communication with employees, Limit the amount of new drivers so employees can actually make a living
﻿How uber eats rips off drivers, You can make good money if they let you stay in the Boost areas, Here in Tucson they will boost all the way around the city but in the middle of the city they won't put a boost and guess what happens they know the drivers will sign on cuz they're in the Boost areas but they will send them into the areas in the middle of town each time to take a delivery because they know if you don't take the delivery they will not give you deliveries for the rest of the night so they' dont boost..., Start listening to drivers I'm thinking of a way to get all drivers in Tucson one night not to answer the phone for half an hour to force Uber to boost all areas does the restaurants will be really upset if there's no drivers  nov 14 201u
﻿Happy to be part of the future, - highly impactful work - fast-paced supportive culture, - college-quality food - things move very quickly, 
﻿Scenario Specialist, The people benefits pay work, I have not come across any cons, I absolutely love working here. This is the best experience I've had at any job.
﻿An Incredible Place with Incredible People, Lots of resources and great communication from all levels, Production oriented and some long hours., try to make it a bit more family friendly
﻿City Operations Intern, great working environment great people and food, not enough structure for an intern., the management was restructuring hence it was a period of uncertainty
﻿Great team and awesome challenges, , , 
﻿Reduced Earnings, I'm my own boss. I get to meet new people. Flexible hours. Uber is a lot more recognized than Lyft so you get more calls than Lyft., High commission. App doesn't make sense. App doesn't work right. Uber pool is a complete scam especially out of airport. If you're in the queue and someone takes an Uber pool: half the pay. You take extra passengers and people in the queue wait longer. Total mess right there. Uber also plays a lot of games. I caught them stealing tips and not applying boost or surge pricing to my earnings many times., Hire me because most of you appear to be incompetent
﻿Ubereats pay and support is abysmal., You set your own hours, cost the driver to drive for uber eats when you figure in gas and wear and tear. Can't contact support if needed., If you pay double you still wont be paying as much as grubhub. Pay your drivers more.
﻿Convenient, I am able to drive on my own schedule make whatever I can each time I drive, It can be speratic on how much you make, Work more for the drivers we are the ones making money for the company
﻿Fulfilling internship experience at ATG, - challenging realistic problem that have a big impact - interns are treated in the same way as full-times: trusted with internal information expected to make real impacts - Great people that are smart and ready to help - Fantastic working environment. Love the adjustable-height desk. - Great mentoring system. Everyone is appointed a manager and a mentor. - Great perks., Can't think of any... less meetings maybe?, Keep it up
﻿Customer Service Rep, taxed for über credits unhealthy food choices favoritism general call center issues no flexibility in scheduling was told to make sacrifices rather than finding a way to maintain life work and school, inform employees of taxing on uber credits better food choices and catering menus, 
﻿Delivery, Work on your own time., Restaurant menu's are not always up to date., 
﻿The best and brightest people anywhere. Awesome opportunities but highly stressful., The best and brightest people anywhere. The opportunity to learn a lot and to be a pioneer. Start-up culture defined., Super fast pace highly demanding highly stressful., 
﻿Eng Manager, Quite stressful amount of work and lack of work life balance expect to work really hard!, Help get great quality leadership in place that are really good at leading people and can really harness the overall team capacities., 
﻿Amazing, Loved the work and culture. Amazing opportunity for everyone, It gets hectic sometimes though, nothing
﻿csr, Its a good concept but the company is not professional enough to handle the growth!, Customer service is so inadequate and unprofessional for a computer this size. It doesn't provide the basics of telephone communication between the customer and a CSR. Everything is done through email and text. And it is all generic answers to specific problems. Sure they refer you to a generic help page that really never has the problem that a customer is dealing with. Never solving the problem, YOU NEED TO PROVIDE TELEPHONE ACCESS FOR THE CUSTOMER S TO SPEAK WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE! PERTAINING TO ALL HELP NEEDS!
﻿Driving for Uber, Meet a lot of nice people and work when you want, Sometimes they would send me to a wrong address, N/A
﻿Greenlight Expert III, Great team and good people to work with, Management is a little vague on rules., Be more clear and don't fluctuate on policies.
﻿A decent flexible job but not a career., Flexible. Good for students or as a side job., No room to grow. A "job" not a "career"., It would be nice to have free cell service if you meet a certain hour cap a month. If not random bonuses for good ratings.
﻿Good side job, Love to work when you wanted to work, Lot of work on your car, 
﻿Great team and atmosphere, ppl at Uber are really energetic and are willing to try new stuff to test what they want, overtime hours are pretty common, 
﻿Driver partner, There is no interest left to work with xli uber bcos earnings are zero, No promotional incentives.mumbai uber customer care is the most ruthless and non co operating.Staff.Entire mumbai uber is in mess.Very rude.no problem resolution.Just a show biz to attract and lure new partner drivers in mumbai uber, Sincere advice to management to concentrate on payment structure and incentives of partner drivers.instead of wasting time and energy on false commitments attractions on uber app.If uber wants to sustain in market than they have to work hard sincerely and with better courteous customer care staff.
﻿Run!!!!!, None I hate Suber wish it never exist, Little pay 95% of time gas money No disregard for drivers at all, Please treat your driver's better or you won't last long I HATE uber. Can't wait until the day I see on the news Uber is non existent. That will be the happiest day of my life.

﻿My favorite place to work by far, Culture people perks (lunch snacks Uber credits). Fast paced challenging environment, Lack of communication across organizations lack of structure tedious interview process., 
﻿Data Science Intern experience at Uber, Wonderful time and my first day was the all-hands meeting for Susan Fowler., There are obviously issues with the culture but I was shielded from them as an intern., 
﻿Great work place, Work culture food transport co - workers management perks work place fun at work strong team leads and managers values and obsession for betterment, tiresome work high expectations from leadership tools yet to be modified transparency is feeble less motivation by managers and very little interaction with the leadership team, to conduct regular meetings for every individual and show them the growth pattern and motivate them to work better and look for opportunities in the company.

﻿Inspiring once in a lifetime journey, My 2-year journey at Uber has been the most thrilling and rewarding. Every single aspect of working at Uber is incredible if you're up for the challenge. You'll meet some of the most passionate smartest and dynamic set of colleagues who are deeply inspired by the mission of Uber. Every single person I've met here deeply cares about the company. There hasn't been a single day in the past 2 years where I haven't felt..., I guess you've heard this before.. The food is free but not that great. Although I very much appreciate the fact that it is free., Management should continue to invest into talent and try their best to retain our best and passionate people.

﻿Innovative company, Remote working great benefits free credits for rides/eats, Young inexperienced workforce politically heavy in regional offices., Stop hiring C people
﻿I did the math less than minimum wage, Work when you want. There are no other pros!, Not worth it at all you make less than minimum wage. Does to cover any portion of your car use insurance gas and etc... No tips means less than minimum wage. I rarely get tips., Compensate drivers fairly.
﻿Barely a job, , , 
﻿Uber miss leading bonus pay, You get more ride Uber is cheaper for the rider there for the pay for the driver is less also. A lot less than you make with Lyft. Customer service is terrible half the people barely speak English you can't understand a word they say., I signed up under a friend I was supposed to receive $250.00 after 40 rides I was told that wasn't the promotion at the time I signed up basically they cheated me out of my bonus, Training for customer service
﻿An Uber driver prospective review, flexibility independence control time management comfort, No resume or skills building no future job growth social stigma possibility of automated cars the new face of corporate culture through nano-economy not an employee but merely a "partner"., Take money out for taxes
﻿SOo much fun, Lots of benefits and perks, Not much growth and pay could be more, Work on cons maybe?
﻿Love working with Uber!, Amazing perks. Love the work environment. Crazy food. Lovely colleagues., Nothing bad to mention about., 
﻿Uber CSR experience in Cairo, Uber is a very fast-paced environment which helps you improve your own skills., It's also the fast-paced environment as you learn and expand your knowledge you are always outside your comfort zone. Sometimes I feel that I need to take some rest., Bring more autonomy like the past days.
﻿Good Job, Lunch/Good Environment/Uber Benefits and promos, Small Pay and hard to grow, 
﻿marketing, the exams are hard not easy, that the boss are way to call, nothinggg
﻿Started out good......, Work when you want. Very flexible schedule and you get to meet new people and find new places in your city., Prices keep dropping it don’t effect Uber but it effects drivers. It’s not even worth driving for Uber anymore. Costs are to high to make any profit., Think of drivers first without them you go out of business
﻿Pretty good gig., I love that I can pick up some fares when I know that I'm going to the south end of town. It's quite a drive so that pretty much at least covers the gas. Hey I was going anyway! I love meeting people and everyone is taking Uber for different reasons. I don't like hearing stories about bad driver experiences though. That makes it bad for all of us., Although so many things have been added to the app I do wish I could see all the other drivers out there. I could then go to another area where there would be a little less waiting., Since we now wait off property for the airport we are put in queue automatically when we are in the waiting area. I happen to live inside that area and there should be a way to choose to not be in the queue. Instead I have to drive far enough away to be taken out of the queue. Thanks for looking at that.
﻿Mixed. They try., Great team with technically interesting project. Ideas and innovations are supported and sometimes encouraged., Contractors are not allowed to perform any work at all from a distance. The reasons given make no sense. I finished ahead of schedule and was "rewarded" with a 10 minute lead time for layoff., Don't lie to people about the reasons behind a policy that makes no technical or behavioral sense at all. Quite simply causes bad blood. Both contract and full time employees are irritated by the "no work at all from home" policy applied senselessly to contractual technical employees while full time employees are supported in working from home. If you trust us to work for you and you provide us with VPN and laptops you...
﻿Intern, Lots of responsibility and ownership., No real cons - worked really hard, 
﻿Mixed Feelings at the Premier Food Delivery Platform, In many ways the team is like my second family. I have a lot of flexibility to take care of my kids when they get sick. When we aren't rolling out new promotions I have the freedom to shift my hours and work remotely as needed. It really is great. Our team is pretty small but everyone I work with is really chill. That said when the work has to get done we get it done! We get new challenges every day so you will never..., Uber/UberEATS keeps a pretty small core of full-time people and contracts out the rest. This is pretty normal for the other high-profile tech startups I've been with in the last ten years. I don't work with them directly but we use a lot of contractors. Several people on my team complain constantly about how much time they spend doing quality control on contractor work. Automation helps a lot but at the end of the day..., Invest more into solidifying what the company has built over the past few years. We need a firm foundation. Look to other successful startups and model what they do right with their brand management. Get these lawsuits under control! We have a solid concept and great market capture but users are losing confidence and shifting to other platforms because of the bad press.
﻿High Turnover Low Opportunity, -positive forward-thinking innovative team -solid benefits, - low pay -limited upward mobility -inflexible hours -monotonous daily tasks with no variation, -raise pay above $15/hr. -provide opportunities for growth
﻿Sales Representative, Some of the pros working here are the benefits and the chill atmosphere., UberEATS is still in a sort of start up phase so they do not have a lot of things figured out such as comp and performance requirements, 
﻿Ops Manager, 1) Autonomy 2) Challenging problems to solve 3) Global outlook, 1) Culture is still getting refined, 
﻿Way less than minimum wage, I did 10 total deliveries for this horrible immoral company. Not one delivery paid more than $3. The average was $2.65 per delivery and they don't give you your tips. By the end of one night I calculated that the money I made that night would not even cover the gas I used driving. What an absolute joke working for this company is. I mean literally are you serious UberEATS?, Less than $2/hr payments. Don't give you tips and don't even show if you were tipped in the first place on the app., Pay your drivers more than 1/5 the current minimum wage. Pay your drivers more than the cost of gas to even make the deliveries in the first place.
﻿Uber teaches me a lot, Push you to learn tons of things, intensive for a little bit, Allocate resources more wisely and enhance communication between teams
﻿Make it great again, - If you enjoy a challenge Uber is a dynamic fast pace work place - The people - Free catering - Personally I had many mentoring opportunities, - Under paid on most levels - Under valued and under appreciated. Never once do you received any perks bonus's shout outs As a top performer it seemed they just kept giving me more because I could "do" more and let me team mates lag behind. - Senior and Middle management are not aligned (not all but most) - Different departments try to undermine each other - HR washes their hands clean instead of looking after..., Uber was a place dreams were made of the company had grown past that point now. However there is time to empower your staff and fix some very real internal problems.
﻿Engineering at Uber, It's very dynamic and you can learn a lot of things, The pressure on engineers sometimes is too high Also often there's way too much process - plannings RFCs, 
﻿Only good for the brand be ready to be isolated, Strong brand get as much from this as you can., - toxic culture contract employees are shunned - claim to be a meritocracy but do not practice, Treat your people with respect.
﻿Brand Ambassador, INCREDIBLE POSITION! I worked in the Chicago market and had a wonderful experience as a Brand Ambassador. This is an effortless job you literally get paid to take ride with competitors such as Lyft and Via. I never had to go in to an office so this job is perfect for someone who is a student has an existing full-time job and travels a lot. 10/10 I loved it!, -Not long term it only lasted for a few months -A lot of necessary paper work you have to complete after every ride, 
﻿The worst company, Can't tell nothing good. They killing market., Cheap company. They never care about workers., 
﻿Get what you put into it, , , 
﻿Sr. Software Engineer, Lots of learning and growth opportunity really amazing teammates in the prime days it's really an awesome opportunity to expand your knowledge and network, Management is maturing hope everything will become better, 
﻿Driver, Flexibility of being able to work when you want, Uber is greedy. Fares constantly adjusting. Have to call a hotline if you cannot find a solution trough the app., Uncertain if there is management. Implement a direct point of contact for your drivers.
﻿Amazing Experience, Over the last 4 years of my life Uber was my life. I lived and breathed the company and everything it had to offer. It was an honor to help this company grow in LatAm and work with so many smart driven and generally good people. Working long hours working on the weekends and the hustling was generally not a problem because I was constantly inspired to keep going. Would not change my experience at Uber for any other..., Some of the people in leadership are too young and immature for their roles. They are really bright and driver but that doesn't necessarily make them good leaders. There is a human aspect to being a leader that is lacking in some. The compensation team was never a team that thought the people were the most important aspect of the company. When negotiating salary shoot high otherwise its going to be really tough once..., Before you give someone the responsibility of leading other people make sure that they have the know how as to how to lead people.
﻿CSR, Nice place and people. It is a diferent work because im able to know people a round the world acrros the computer. It's funny because only with a computer i can help people and that is satisfying., I feel that anyone cares about who you are or what happens to you. Maybe 1 person at less and that makes us know less as a team., Be more intuitive abouth people someting more important thant the work is the persons who do that work.

﻿Good company terrible culture., The benefits and the perks offered by Uber are pretty good., Uber has a long road ahead to establish a positive culture within the company. I am the newest employee in a Greenlight Hub location. I was a partner "driver" for Uber previously and really fell in love with the company and the platform. Now that I have been an employee of the company it has completely changed my outlook. I have been employed with Uber since July 27th 2017. Since my initial week of training off the floor...,

It's quite a hassle to contact support and communicate with them., I don't know what to say. It's fair most of the time and sometimes it's not.
﻿part time, partime whenever I want to drive, rate changes rate cuts no consistent pay scale unsafe, 
﻿Uber is a Con Not a Scam, If you like working for less than minimum wage its perfect, Adjust rates to allow drivers to earn a wage., How can you abide by people subsidizing your company in every respect?
﻿Uber partner/Driver, Know new people everyday share experiences have fun with them, Almost nothing except sometimes you get stacked with super drunk ones and make mess up in your vehicle like vomiting and stuff., Please hire me because I have a vast work experience of more than 22 years in different companies and different levels of responsibilities. I assure you that I would be a great asset for the company and will work so hard to bring the company's objectives done.
﻿Data Analyst, I have absolutely loved my experience at Uber. The people are passionate the projects are highly important and the culture is fantastic. I have been amazed at every corner by the people I work with and it never ends., Because Uber is now beginning to "realign" and formalize as a company there are many aspects that seem to be somewhat ad hoc. As the company matures these processes will become formalized., Keep pushing the limit!
﻿Grow fast and make magic, Environment of professional and personal growth with employees who pull us up and teach us every day to be more. We change the world and the lives of people with the push of a button that's the main thing., Giant startup with some communication flaws where sometimes it is little and in others it is too much., The young employees is self-motivated but with little professional and personal maturity merging with more experienced people will help in the evolution of all and even the company.
﻿Learning a lot everyday as an Engineer, - Work environment is great - Engineers are really passionate about what they build, - Struggling to hire so teams slightly understaffed due to external reputation but that is starting to change, 
﻿Uber vs. Lyft, Freedom to work when and (within limits one state) where you want. Generally a fun job with nice customers if you're nice., When something goes wrong it's almost impossible to get help to fix it at Uber & Lyft . I couldn't work for 3 days while paying for a rental because I got a new phone number and they kept sending verification codes to old number and that was with help in one of their offices. Both companies are trying to make things better., Realize how important your driver's are and treat them better. Give them a better deal on rental and lease exchange cars.
﻿I have been working at Uber full-time (Less than a year), , , 
﻿Execs At Uber should Read this, Pay is so low that you need tips in order to sustain. But here is the rub. There tip system (even the new improved one) is lame. They should make it so customers can tip at the beginning of an order like when you order a pizza from Papa Johns. Instead you have to deliver the order then leave. And hope they tip you online afterwards. This discourages people from tipping when you are out of sight out of mind., With such low pay tips are everything. I know you think you improved ubereats by finally putting in a tip system but it's a lame one. I would suggest Uber execs forgo their salary for a year and work as an ubereats driver. I'm pretty sure you silver spoon fed execs who had your parents pay for your college never worked a tip job. If you did you'd know better than to put this lame system into play and to fix..., 
﻿UberEATS Delivery Partner review, Able to work whenever wherever., Depends on consumer demand sometimes., 
﻿Software Engineering Intern, People aren't as willing to help each other as other places, Motivate employees more. Don't rely just on internal individual motivation, 
﻿Accountability and meritocracy, Brand--having the Uber brand behind UberEATS allows you to scale business quickly. Knowledge and resources--unlimited access to learning and best practices from around the world., Management implements initiatives that are not thought-out or prepared to handle internal crisis-communication; sales commissions were not paid correctly for 5 consecutive months from May 2017-October 2017., Don't view people as a prototype.
﻿sometimes you deal with drunk passengers, The only thing i like a about it is you can stop anytime you want it, Because is fast money to make and it’s about you how you want it to make the money, Is good for extra cash for paying bills

﻿Good for what it is, , , 
﻿HR - People Ops Coordinator, Good place to work nice environment and culture Team support, Everything is streamlined Nothing to say more., We already have good Uber Credit points as per Uber policy But I travel total 60kms per day from home to office and office to home. Looking forward to have more credits points for those who stay far away if possible.
﻿Operator, A VERY good company to work for. Pay is great. Excellent benefits. The perks are wonderful! Supervisors and managers are extremely easy to work for and usually are willing to help you succeed in you career. A GREAT place to work., Some of the reasons that you can be terminated is a bit alarming and I feel can be better corrected through progressive discipline. However maintaining focus will prevent a termination. #stayfocus, Great job Tempe crew! One thing though...take your staff seriously. There are people within your ranks that has a lot to offer Uber....help them succeed to their destination.
﻿Let Builders Build, • lots of creative freedom • tremendous amount of data at your fingertips • the smartest hardest working colleagues • insane comraderie • you feel like you're really making a difference in your city • hyper passionate colleagues • coworkers feel like family, • hours • can be REALLY stressful • can be very much "us v. them", We can make big differences in the world and still get 8 hours of sleep.

﻿Company Rating, A very dynamic workforce with loads of potential for all employees, Thankfully none that comes to mind, Have more sports groups to participate in tournaments eg. football basketball etc. Not just running.
﻿Uber Driver, Give platform for part time of full time to earn money. High earnings just by using your car., No medical or accident coverage. Driver bear alot of cost, Reviews of total driver benefits and structure need to be done. It's seem Uber getting easy income while driver do the hard work.
﻿Share your experience at Uber, Proximity - it's really close to where I live so I don't need to experience the everyday hassle of heavy traffic public transportation and the stress that comes with it., The company offers free lunch but for those working on a graveyard shift they often have to wait until food is replenish or the quality of food is really bad. The company has to make sure that the concessionaire delivers the same quality of food for all employees regardless of their work schedule. Also tissue or napkins are limited during graveyard shift one facility staff that my teammate spoke with told them that..., There's something wrong with the work culture of this company. Maybe this is just from the LOB where I'm from. Most of the people in position particularly Team Leaders do not have people management skills even leadership skills. There's one TL in the morning shift who speaks so loud that some of the agents no longer respect him/her. Some agents speak so loud that they become a distraction to some people who shares the...

﻿Inspiring place to work, - extremely challenging problems to solve - fast moving industry - no one else have solved these kind of problems at scale - employees who take pride in their work and put passion to provide the best service to drivers and riders and all stakeholders, - can be a bit chaotic to a new person - hard to plan for future work as new things keep coming, 
﻿Ambitious company with wonderful people, UberEATS is growing ridiculously fast and there's a lot of room for professional development and upwards mobility if you are willing to put in the work. Great time to be joining the company. If you're an actual employee benefits are comprehensive and excellent. Health vision life dental Uber credits gym compensation unlimited PTO. Excellent workforce. Never disliked a coworker and everyone works hard but maintains..., Still a relatively new company. Lots of things are decided on a micro level and a lot of processes are bands aids which can be frustrating if you like structure. Bad PR isn't pleasant but the company has been pivoting trying to improve and has been involved with major charitable work that helps make you proud to work here. Despite cultivating a start up work ethic there's is several facets of the job that are..., 
﻿Lots of growth opportunities but policies need to be revisited and refined further, - Free meals and snacks - Uber credits - Really nice office - Transparency (everyone is kept in the loop on what's happening even before it reaches the media) - Huge company meaning there are lots of opportunities for growth and you get the chance to work on various projects and meet different people, - The holiday attendance policy needs to be revisited. I understand why COE COS/agents are expected to report to work on a public holiday but for those who work in the COE but aren't agents/aren't handling tickets I don't understand why it's really necessary for us to be at work (think of the money that could have been saved by letting some employees have the holidays off instead of spending it on paying employees'..., - The holiday attendance policy needs to be customized depending on employees' roles or functions within the company and should not be based on the employee's level or rank only. It shouldn't be a "one size fits all" approach.
﻿Interesting Year, Great benefits Rewarding to build from scratch, Poor leadership from the top of my org. Xchange Leasing closing., Transparent communication goes a long way.
﻿ubereats, same as others . just the thing is ubereats sends sms to merchants and customers so they react when order and drivers coming .., new pay is 30 cent less now . minimum 30 . just make math and you will see ... why I need to get payed for time if you still get less . the salary comes from computers and programs ., if it would make any sense
﻿The best company to work for, Ambitious yet very supportive culture Trust and independent decision making Mission driven people, May be a bit too much comms and meetings, Don't abandon the foundations of the culture - "let builders build" and "always be hustling "
﻿Office Manager, They take great care of you and give you everything you could want and more. However I got lucky with an amazing manager - some people are not so lucky. Who your manger is can really change how you feel about the company., Not much guidance with career path or growing in the role., 
﻿Team Lead, It is a great company to work since I have learned a lot from the agents and the other TL's are supportive., The schedules could be more flexible., 
﻿Love working here!, - Fast-paced innovative company - Not only am I working on exciting new projects everyday I am also making an impact on the business and the overall marketplace. Not many 23-year olds can say that they've had the opportunity to move the needle on so-and-so marketplace metric which has to led to significant real-world improvements - Passionate young team of like-minded individuals, - Ebb and flow of work - I will have some slower weeks and then longer more stressful weeks. Not really a con and more a part of the job, 
﻿About work at Uber., 1) Great teamwork 2) Great workplace 3) Harmonious environment 4) ''be yourself", 1) Improvement in feedback 2) improved scales, Encourage peer-to-peer feedback.
﻿Uber Xchange program, At the time ability to get a vehicle, They take huge amounts out of your earnings. They do not follow lease amount. They have stollen funds from my account. I been on them to get it back into my bank account asap. Uber is no help I contacted them several times., Pay your driversIf I do not make money you do not make money.
﻿Do the math carefully before you waste your time., I'm required to enter at least five words into this field., If you do all the math carefully you're going to find that driving for Uber is a zero sum game unless you're working in one of a few very large cities. Everywhere else? Don't bother. You'll be breaking even at best., 
﻿UberEats Cyclist, -Can work whatever hours one wants -Salary depends on how much you want to work. -You pick the hours. -Works right around the corner (if you live in the city)., -Salary can be below minimum wage if there is no work available,

﻿Independent Uber Driver, The only and best thing about this is that you work at your own time but have to put many hours and work during peak times to make any profit., Low pay high expenses mostly bad email customer service and unethical company.

Show some respect and stop cutting pay and increasing our expenses by making us work more for less.
﻿You can choose your hours but, Choosing your hours is the best advantage of this job. You get to meet a lot of people although some just care about their phones and don’t talk to you. You get to see all of the city. I made over 1100 drives and saw very much., Your car takes abuse whether you drive nice and safe or crazy. San Antonio roads have debris everywhere which has to be watched for and avoided. Riders don’t care about your ratings. This is huge. You could be nicest driver and give them the smoothest ride and still get a 4 star rating. The riders don’t understand that eventually this leads to contract death. I was hit by a hit-and-run driver and was taken out of..., Look at 4 star ratings and not take drivers out of contracts. Drivers are valuable and use their own vehicles to do their job. Riders can be heartless and have no idea what the driver rating pressures are causing to the driver’s

﻿Five Star, The pay was one of he best parts of doing Uber. I also one bed interacting with all types of different people and exploring places I'd never been before. Controlling your hours is a huge perk to driving for Uber. I would (and have) recommend Uber to everyone I know (especially full time college students)., I am allergic to cigarette smoke the smell of it alone causes me to get horrible migraines. Some riders would smoke in the car or just before they got in the car and consecutive riders would complain about the smell., Provide full coverage car insurance and car inspections for vehicles over the age limit to help people stay on with this amazing company! Offer benefits for full time employees!
﻿Excellent company to progress professionally and work together with very experienced people, Improve people’s lifestyle in the city. Modernize the way people move in the city. A city is not the same since Uber is available in it., The workflow makes you spend more time of the day at work than at pleasure. Many times our workflow is interrupted by local authorities due to the regulatory issues, 
﻿Uber, Flexible hours. Potential big earning if willing to pay the price. Free to serve wherever and can work on preferred areas., Uber pays much lower than Lyft. Profit and expenses are not adding up. If you want to make the most pay you need to work like a horse especially during very early morning hour or late at night to earn plenty. Uber always sided with rider's interests and never cared about driver's explanation even on a $5 less dispute. Facts never mattered. Uber only cares about making riders happy. Nevermind the drivers or whatever explanation..., Return investor's money and file bankruptcy. Governments and communities around the world are better served without Uber. News about Uber getting kicked out around the globe is a growing trend that represents Uber's unethical corporate culture and image. Just look at Uber's history in Bulgaria Demark Hungary Italy China Taiwan London-UK Vancouver-Canada Austin-Texas and Alaska.
﻿Great place to start your career, Lots of perks plus fun and young office environment, Overly competitive workplace present within the company can be too exhausting at times, 
﻿Operations and Logistics Inter, Hands On experience excellent Mentorship, expense of living in LA, 
﻿Account Rep, amazing team great people and office, there is not one at all, Keep it up
﻿Internship, - A great learning opportunity. - You have the ability to move around and contribute to projects that aren't directly associated with you're department. - The people are amazing., The program is still fairly new so it's a little unorganized., 
﻿UberX Baltimore, Flexible schedule Easy money Weekly pay or instant cashout, Some riders leave less than 5 stars and never say why Driver rating system is unfair (actually starts at 4 stars where 4.0 average rating is grounds for termination and 4.8+ is good) Riders cannot add stops making some rides really inconvenient, 
﻿Good flexibility for part time, You can log in to drive at any time of day when you’re free; surges help pay a little extra, Slightly scary not knowing who is getting in the car; when nobody requests a ride for a whole, 
﻿Marketing Intren, Exciting and cool place to work great colleagues, There is no life-work balance, 
﻿Driver Partner, Choosing your own schedule is the best benefit of being a driver., The disrespectful & intoxicated riders., Stand behind your workers especially when they have problems. Pay them a fair living wage. Don't treat us as disposable commodities.
﻿Ultra-Flexible, Possibility to work whenever you want, Oversaturated offer of drivers at some times, 
﻿There are great places to work and Uber surpasses that by far!, I have been working at Uber Mexico for 9 months. Started as an external then got converted to FTE. It has been the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life. the company really cares for its employees and I feel like I can contribute to society just by coming in to work., Losing your seniority when converted it's as if I started all over again. But worth it either way!, 
﻿Great company to work for, Make your own schedule flexible 401k, Sometimes long hours drunk people get obnoxious, 
﻿My First 3 months at Uber Company, The values the personal development and the proud to be here, I can't see this by now, Keep doing better and harder
﻿partner uber, I meet new people all over the world.Ican start anytime and i can end anytime basicly the jod work with you.., thecons is u need keep gas money and tollway, My advice to a mangement is uber great jod for customer seviceron time and know how to take direction ..
﻿Good time to get in, Your work can have great impact. It is still a growing business and impacts so many lives in a positive way. Most people I have met at the company are awesome and very unlike the image that is portrayed in the media. I am sure things changed after the events of this year., Uber has grown too explosively and there are so many people doing the same thing. Too much redundancy and too many people now., Consolidate functions.
﻿Data Analyst Intern, free food and catered lunch nice facilities and amenities, reeeeallly long hours leadership does not care about your growth in the company employees do not share camaraderie request terminations of people on the team, establish a less hostile work environment with a better work/life balance
﻿Crap pay but kinda fun, Work when you want. No boss to answer to. Instant pay (if you set that up.), Under $3 for one delivery is common. McDonalds are the worst trips., Don't take a generous 35% cut for simply giving us access to your service. That's absurd. Hire competent support personnel.
﻿ambiguous position, Possibility to communicate with RCOs learn more about Jira and reporting., No changes in salary from CSR/TL (17.09.30). More work to do. Work is futile no serious changes will happen., 
﻿Good until your car needs repair, Flexible hours work at your own pace, Low pay considering the vehicle maintenance, Offer vehicle maintenance incentives...i.e. after 3 months of 4 or 5 star reviews a free oil change
﻿good and bad, convenient with sechdules  easy to make money, low number of requests long waitings not enough money., 
﻿Background Check Researcher, -Fun Environment -Great people to work with -Awesome perks, -Pay isn't that great -Not many advancement opportunities -Commute, Pay better and open up more positions for advancement or your good people will leave for other companies
﻿Very up and down, Can make a lot of money if you figure out how to work surges., Times can be very dull based on time of day. Hourly pay can vary A LOT, 
﻿Fun and profitable, Work when you want and enjoy the folks you ride around town. Engage with the riders and have fun., Use it for what is. A side gig. This is not a full time career choice., Keep improving. Everyday.
﻿Expert, Great management great office staff - love it! Often have lunch provided Bryan is a great manager. Love it., Not enough hours just part time - This is a con but I knew this going in. They were very open about the position., Thanks for always making us feel welcome and appreciated. Celebrating accomplishments & providing for us is great.
﻿Do not recommend working here, -Easy work -Casual setting (no need for business causal attire) -Excessively lenient on taking vacation time (for frequent travelers), -Little to no value for contract employees -Monotonous -Employ fake team centric dynamic to compensate for the fact that there is little to no upward mobility available -Extremely toxic environment, -Hire more managers with EQ -Don't lead your employees into thinking there are full-time opportunities when there are not -Hire smarter (i.e: numerous full-time hires are inept while you have fully capable contract employees)
﻿Operations, -High-tech opportunity of working with the smarter people self-challenge high-pay, -Leadership: Despite central leadership is fabulous in Uber but in the cities nobody cares about employees via questioning GMs or Managers if business KPIs are good. Sometimes managers are being assigned by some GMs without passing quality criteria just because of personal relations and trust whereas it might be chaostic for a team if you have a senior who is unable to lead or coach. -No gross is available if you're..., -Anonymous feedbacks on management would be helpful.
﻿Ok gig..., Start/Finish whenever you want. Ability to be paid whenever you want for a small $0.50 fee. No boss breathing down your neck., Finicky pax that don't understand the ratings system. Very few people tip. Tons of miles on your car., Start reminding pax's that drivers are in the service industry and tipping is customary especially when drivers help them with their bags/luggage.
﻿Uber ok, , , 
﻿Driver, Delivery taxi. It's a great work sisteme, $15.00 I'll been working for one and a half year, Love it. Working for Uber. Great experience
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Uber is great for extra money but not as a full time job, Flexibility work with great passengers (generally), Average about 8/hour when you factor in gas taxes and wear and tear on vehicle. Not worth it., pay your drivers more. benefits would be nice.
﻿Great Place to work, Really smart people really great teams really great environment. It's an amazing place to work in a company experiencing some sensational growth. You get to own your projects and write your own path., In ANZ still somewhat of a start up often times you get TOO much ownership over your own projects and not enough guidance..., 
﻿UBER Expert, Best company I have ever worked for. Always asking for feed back on their performance and really care about their employee. The benefits are amazing. I feel encouraged to be myself and bring ALL of my ideas to the table., THere are none that I can think of, Keep it up I especially love the diversity and inclusion efforts.
﻿Started out good, You get to work on your own time. Great if you need a little bit of cash flow fast., Advertising to hire a lot of drivers for a very small area. Too many drivers for such a small area doesn't leave any room to make money., Stop advertising for drivers in small towns. If we aren't' making money and just acquiring wear and tear on our vehicles as well as paying more for insurance it's not really worth it.
﻿UBER is the worst company EVER !! The name should be ''Uber Slavery'' !!, You can make your own schedule..., You are NOT going to make a steady sum of $$ per week. Uber has too many drivers. The IT support is horrible. It feels like you are communicating with robots or really stupid people. They always have a non-sense prompt answer never related to the problem you have. So in other words the - only - concern they have about the workers is regarding on how to control them to maintain this modern slavery they invented., 
﻿Good Job, You make good money on weekends and you can meet new people and places everyday, the bad part is that uber has uber pool feature  where you cant make money and they pay really bad, 
﻿On Demand Delivery . . . good me me?, Complete freedom to set own work/delivery schedule (hours location etc) with full acceptance of the contracting entity UberEATS. Tips/Gratuities may be included with over all fees for delivery/services and entire tip/gratuity is paid in very timely manner to contracted driver., Must keep detailed records for State Federal Personal Income Taxes to be paid quarterly as well as "health and welfare" taxes such as self-employee FICA (Social Security and Disability). This may be time consuming but necessary., Provide smartphone apps to contract drivers to keep track of all Tax payments required by law.
﻿Beware, SAG desks and teams are better because you are not getting constant calls from various company's customers who are angry 99% of the time. I worked on SAG team and we basically had our own accounts and you build a rapport with the shippers in most cases., Holiday season is the worst. They take everyone off of their usual account to help with the heavy call volume. All of the calls are BS and you are not empowered to handle anything during the phone call. Everything that you can do the customer can do themselves on the website., Leadership skills are seriously lacking. The leads are very bias and hang in cliques. The company should hire professional trainers to get quality leaders instead of dictators.
﻿Good Side Job, It is a convient job that is controlled by an app so you can start and stop whenever you want . Its fun meeting, Low fares and over abundance of drivers makes it hard to make money most days and you have to be out Friday and Sat night hauling drunk people around to make a decent buck. Unless your in a Big City you probably have a hard time doing this as a full time job., Maybe find ways to limit drivers in smaller cities so drivers have a desire to stay.
﻿The Best Company to Work for if you want a Challenge!, Everyone is constantly learning. You are working with the best and brightest people., It would be nice to have 401k matching., Continue to take advice from your employees to make changes.
﻿Best Company, Environment Benefits management literally the entire job, None to report at the moment, Keep up the good work
﻿Community Operation Specialist, Beyond my expectation. Great people here and i am more blessed to be one of them., Nothing. Everything just perfect. Not even missed a bit., 
﻿3rd month review, Good work place and nice people to work with, I can't see anything wrong with the work place and people that I work with., Keep on making employees happy to make Uber's company successful
﻿Green Light Expert, great benefits amazing technology great team, lack of a permanent location, 
﻿uber driver, , , 
﻿Not what it seems., Work when i want if i dont care about how much i make., Long hours for little pay. Taxes are huge at the end of the year. Wear on your car 100k miles in 2 years., Increase milage rate. Stop taking so much of the fare (35% 20% plus 1.55 of every run averages out to 35% per trip.) is way to much for what you do for your drivers ie. Advertise and process payments.
﻿Driver, Flexibility and you can get this with many other driver apps. This company may have started it but they don't have the ethical business standards to keep it going., Undisclosed changes regarding fare pricing. You lose more money than you make and can be put in some dangerous situations., Start treating your drivers with respect and dignity. Also compensate drivers fairly and reasonably.
﻿my experience, , , 
﻿2-year experience, good opportunities fast growth develop tech skills, no work & life balance, NA
﻿Uber employment, Extra cash no taxes deducted, No Taxes deducted and rental fees for car usage is outrageous, Deduct taxes And lower rental fees
﻿Only if you're desperate, You get to pick your own hours Quick cash, The rating system is awful Management is no help The passengers are terrible Pay isn't that great, Get rid of that rating system. I don't know why passengers expect more than a safe clean and comfortable ride from point a to point b but that's what they paid for. I shouldn't get a low rating because the passenger wasn't entertained as well.
﻿money, You are your own boss, sitting all day long and dealing with customers, better offers for drivers.
﻿Great job, , , 
﻿really nice company, back office job and good schedule, no chance to do extra time, 
﻿driver, great for anyone who needs to make their own schedule., uber support can be a headache it took me 3-4 back and forth emails to get mia airport staging lot location., 
﻿Uber SG, - Well bonded team - Manager meets up with us fortnightly to update us on our progress and offers encouragement - Catered buffet lunch, - Job is very KPI driven: if you did not manage to hit your KPI you will have to explain to your manager - Job can be very repetitive and boring, 
﻿The best company in the world, Great opportunity Friendly staff The image of the company Great benefits Interesting tasks, There are no downsides at all, 
﻿Marketing Manager, Uber is without a doubt one the best places a person can work for these days. And there are only few such companies exist. The most dynamic environment where life changing projects are born. If you are brave enough to change the world don't afraid to hustle and willing to meet best professionals - Uber is a very right place., no cons detected within my experience, 
﻿Working At Uber, Great environment Great work life balance Great benefits Great culture Great people Great community involvement Great company events Diversity & Inclusion Uber looks good on a resume, Opportunities from entry level Compensation on some levels, 
﻿Latam Media Lead, it´s a highly disruptive way to work all can make your point and the idea it´s that everyone are being heard. The crew are full of smart and really intelligent people what it´s absolutely challenging environment., Sometimes it´s complicate just because as everyone can express your opinion have a clear guide or take a quick decision can take more time then expected., Uber it´s a company who is growing really fast has a lot of talent inside bur we must have process to not lose the focus so quick then loose the talents.
﻿UBER is a life saver, Like minded peers working in the same environment. It's fun there's no regrets coming into work each day. Really loved that they provide lap tops to take home and providing lunch to their staff everyday is a blessing. The opportunity for growth is really comforting as well., No negatives come to mind when reflecting on UBER and it's structure., Implememt a yearly raise policy for staff every little bit helps and can help to retain good people.

﻿Wonderful opportunity to have a huge impact on day to day business, Huge responsabilities Important empowerement Owner of the business, Requiring a lot of energy and motivation, 
﻿Learning every single day!, Amazing passion in team members Super smart people to work with everyday Ability to take on responsibility in team and contribute in products Meaningful work of providing real transportation and opportunities to millions of people around the world! Personally I love to wake up and head to work@Uber every single day!!, In too much media light lately, 
﻿Upward Mobility, Great support open to ideas exciting company to work for. Great changes have and are being made, lack of communication (getting better). Lack of a clear way for upward mobility., Give current employees opportunities to move up in company... Let current employees see opportunities for promotions. Earned/Qualified upward mobility should be available and current employees should be notified of opportunities
﻿An incredibly talented staff with way too much to do, As an engineer at Uber you're presented with a unique opportunity to have a very high impact-to-unit-work and to release products that go live instantly worldwide. The IC-level talent is phenomenal; you're working with bright engineers designers and data scientists who all have incredible drive and talent. It's a great place to grow and learn. This has been Uber's biggest value prop to technical members of staff to..., Managers who are supportive proactive and empathetic are unfortunately the exception not the rule. I imagine some of this stems from scope problems (most managers simply have too many direct reports; my first had something near 20) but if you talk with engineers there are a scant few who don't have a story about how their manager really let them down during a promotion cycle review cycle or project in a manner..., Uber's problem seems to be that its eyes are too big for its stomach: its desired scope of product is just too large for the resources it has on-hand. Managers PMs and ICs alike all have too much to do and as a consequence: - Product teams never have the time to add polish to a product because they're forced to move onto the next project to address their (too) many OKRs - Engineers don't have the time to proactively...
﻿Community Operations, , , 
﻿Partner, Flexible hours and be your own boss, Long hours to cover, 
﻿Uber Eats driver, I like that you can work when you log in or not when you're off their platform. But many of the uber eats rides do not tip, In addition to not tipping you are usually ask to pick up orders in high traffic areas where there is no parking. You must find the restaurant to pick up your order but must wait in line with other customers for limited help. Find your car hopefully without a $39 dollar parking ticket the repeat the whole thing again for the delivery . for $3 to $7 dollars per order. It is a job for the working poor., Why can't I be paid for orders that get cancelled or compensated for parking meters.
﻿Losing money to work..., You pick your hours You have one simple job, Driving most of the time is going to cost you more than you earn (after calculating insurance registration wear and tear on vehicles). Plus you don't get consistent trips. The market is saturated and there are times where you often sit for hours without a trip request., Pay less to advertising/marketing Pay more to the people sacrificing their cars
﻿Account Executive, , , 
﻿Uber driver, flexible hours for all drivers, you don't know the destination of the fare and must accept it to find out, 
﻿Great to make your own schedule with a flip of a switch, •Convenient •Set destinations and uber will find you a rider along the way • Great for learning new cities • quick cash, •always pumping gas and cleaning car • wear and tear on car • Sometimes you get that one customer that is not having it • ubering outside a major city is slow, Did a great job adding tips and the set destination along with weekly bonus. The only thing I would change is expanding further.
﻿Driver, Great for side cash I found it hard to make enough to actually pay bills though. I think that it is not the best job because of the wear and tear on your car., The wear and tear on your car as I said. I have heard bad stories of riders making up stories so it's a good idea to get a camera., Pay the drivers more they are using their own cars. I honestly think that people will pay more
﻿not a bad way to make extra cash, make your own hours no supervisors, you must use your own vehicle deal with potentially inebriated passengers (this is also a pro), 
﻿What does it look to work for Uber, , , 
﻿Horrible company to work at, Health benefits free rides nothing else., Horrible company to work at. Management is incompetent. HR department non-existant. Racist xenophobic homophobic management.

﻿It Definitely Requires Brains, Flexible Hours Nice Passengers Earning Incentives., Uberpool Wait Times Saturated Driver Market, 
﻿Organized Chaos, + Surrounded by incredibly talented go-getters + Never boring. If you have a thick skin and can handle the negative press -- Uber is a fantastic environment to push yourself and create incredibly impactful products + Front row seat into a very innovative fast moving explosive company, - Lacks a fine tuned process across design and engineering. At the end of the day incredible things get shipped but at the expense of a few headaches. - Makers and independent contributors often get side tracked by a plethora of disruptive meetings., 
﻿UX Researcher, The working culture is awesome it empowers you to pick your projects access your stakeholders and own your impact on the company.

﻿perfect place if you like favoritism and being punished for doing well, Decent pay amazing benefits. Only reason I'm still here., You will be treated like a child. Your manager will be paid more than you to do absolutely no work at all except for complain about how little work you do even if you're one of the top performers. It's so hard to put into words how horribly you'll be treated here. Despite Meritocracy being a cultural value favoritism runs rampant and there is nothing you can do about it. They will tell you they value your input and..., Management needs to get it together. We're all tired of being told we're valued when we know you're lying to us. Start appreciating the people who do well instead of treating them like the agents who clearly don't know what they're doing.
﻿Smart and Very Flexible but Low Pay, - Very flexible - Smart and creative way to get money - Some good offers for drivers, - Not enough pay back - Sensitive and sometimes dangerous, 
﻿Greenlight Manager, Not only learn things about your role but the business as a whole Closely-knitted team Like-minded proactive individuals, Can get stressful sometimes but if you are willing to learn and grow perfect opportunity for you, Sometimes management shouldn't jump to conclusions too quick especially on the performance

﻿GL Coordinator, I get to make impactful contributions and we get alot of perks., Work about 10-12 hours every day on average., Coach you staff more.
﻿Amazing People Challenging Work Rewarding Experience, Have been afforded every opportunity to take on new challenges and grow my career. Feels like I've been part of 5 different companies given the amount of growth over the past years exciting but very challenging., Due to Uber's rapid growth there can be quite a bit of ambiguity as it relates to goals projects etc. This can be frustrating for some so if you're looking for a consistent day to day with clear metrics Uber might not be the right place for you., 
﻿Uber New Graduate - Operations, Surrounded by smart fun motivated teammates. Management gives you trust and autonomy to make the most of the situation. Everything moves quickly, It ramps up so quickly that some onboarding tasks are lost in the mix., Regularly check in with employees to make sure they are comfortable with the workload.
﻿Good side money, flexible hours and the harder you work the more you will make, uber takes to high of a cut, keep doing what you do
﻿Horrible Pay, Can't think of any pros honestly. Waste of time., For the extra hassle of having to find parking get out walk in walk out etc the pay is peanuts. This on top of not knowing if any sauce or grease might leak out of the delivery onto your seats or floor. I tried it for the first time last night. For almost an hour of doing Eats I barely made $13. Not doing Eats again., Pay should be much higher for the hassles involved.

﻿UBER, you can work your own schedule, dont withold taxes so you have to pay entire social security amount, offer employee stock programs
﻿Uber Expert, Experiencing the company's culture was by far the best pro about working at Uber. I was lucky enough to work in an office where the majority of the workforce was international making it a lively and fun environment. In addition to this I always knew that I could confront my managers. Whether it be to discuss an issue or just have a one-on-one conversation about my performance they were always approachable and willing..., One of the biggest cons about the Uber Expert role in particular was not holding full-time employment status which resulted in a lack of employee benefits., 
﻿good, , , 
﻿Uber is a great place for builders to build!, - Ownership: I have more than 13years of experience in the tech industry and I have never been in a company which that much ownership. I can really feel that I'm the owner of the product I work on and I have lot of freedom to influence the roadmap. - Real impact on customer's life (and more broadly on society) : The impact on customers and cities are real. I can feel it on a day to day basis. - World wide company:..., - All the infrastructure layer are done internally. We don't use any of the cloud public offering like AWS or Azure. Not sure how this will scale in the future. - Lack some structure and process around scrum management and more generally around engineering and management., 
﻿Software engineer, Extremely talented peers can learn a lot, A bit downside on work life balance but its currently being worked on, 
﻿Stressfull, This job can be very flexible, There is a huge competition even if you are an Uber Black driver, Reduce the number of vehicles
﻿Rider driver match, Matching with the rider is sometimes ??? as a driver i always confirm the name and the drop off address with the rider before starting the trip but there are times that i still get a wrong rider picked up ., Please put a start trip button in a riders app for riders to slide once they got in the car before the driver can slide the start trip button, 
﻿Greedy unfair and deceptive, Getting more passengers than other apps, Never rely on their help. They are either unwilling or incapable of taking care of the drivers. Expect to hear lies and inconsistencies in their communication. Feeling to be treated unfairly (which arise anger and other negative emotions), 
﻿Nice company & system, Very flexible time. Get fast money & get meet various of people., The rating system burden driver. Some of customer very arrogant., Please change rating system policy.

﻿Labeler, They give you free food to bribe you into forgetting that they do not care about you. Upper management who do not make decisions about labelers are very nice intelligent and professional. Leads could learn from this., The whole environment is not conducive to a company thriving in the first place. The whole concept of a multi-billion-dollar company hiring through a staffing agency to avoid paying for benefits is disgusting. They have no value in their employees and their employees do not grow loyalty or pride in their employer or place of employment. It does not create pride and professionalism which is only exacerbated by the Casual..., Use positive and negative reinforcement. Appreciate those who have higher productivity. Set higher standards. Establish positive rapport with employees. Do not waste the time of 20+ people in meetings. Encourage employees to find efficient ways of doing things. Do not dress like a homeless person.

﻿Not bad but could be better, Can work when you want and as much as you want, Uber is not good at estimating the travel time to your destination. I have picked up meals in mid-town only to have to drive across the bridge to West Sacramento for a delivery. It may say 10 mins. but in actuality with the traffic it's generally longer. Because it registers 10 mins. you're paid practically nothing for using up $6 in gas and a lot of time. This has happened to me twice already! You go above and..., Advise driver in advance if they are picking up from one neighborhood and delivering to another... or in this case to another city! West Sacramento is not Sacramento proper. The "Grid" in Sacramento is not an easy place to maneuvre; one way streets and little or no parking is available to run in and pick up. These things should be considered and compensated for when asking a driver to go to this area.
﻿Being a Driver is What You Put Into It, Flexible hours No boss Get to drive all kinds of people, Low Pay No Benefits Drunk people in your car Can be hard to be motivated to work or to make sure you are allowing yourself enough not working time, 
﻿Great gig for extra cash!, Great income source as a side gig. It's best to use UBER as a payment source when and if you buy a new car. It will make your car payments effortlessly., You will benefit from having a leather interior.

Uber has added a 24/7 driver help line which has been great being able to actually talk with an agent who can help resolve issues., Waiting at airport staging area after dropping off a passenger may be 2 or 3 hours long and then you might get a trip that is only 23 miles away (or shorter) which means after Ubers cut driver will receive around 18.00. Divide that by 2 hours plus the time for the drive driver makes less that 9.00 an hour. Horrid response time by Uber with few solutions given drivers. Uber just ended their contract with Enterprise and..., Get your act together.

﻿UBER shows it DOESN'T CARE for the welfare for its Driver Partners, I enjoy the way Uber uses incentives and the upward mobility it gave me. I enjoyed meeting everyone I met. I 'm truly a better person from socializing with demographics I wouldn't have been mixed with. The stories would surprise you about beliefs and the personal experiences that say life isn't 0's and 1's. It sometimes felt as if the passengers were meant to be taken to their destination by only me., I asked to relocate to another city and the UBER LOCAL GREENLIGHT HUB said I could move. I liquidated all the inventory in my home business packed up and moved. Uber said it would take up to 3 weeks to start driving. Instead I was denied. Rent was $1250 + utility deposits and I have a kid.I paid my rent again waiting this out while searching for a person with a soul at UBER. I needed Uber to make ends meet. I tried..., My advice for Uber is to take responsibility for the sloppiness. You have drivers who are loyal to you and promote your brand. However I do appreciate Uber for the upward mobility it gave my little family. We were on the way to Upper Middle Class and it felt like the roller coaster ride ended.

﻿Uber Driver, Great employment because you meet a tremendous amount of people. Helps better communication skills. Pay is okay just depends on how much demand there is per day., The pay isn't the greatest. Sometimes you get involved with very rude people. Customer service for drivers sucks because you cannot get in contact with a person. The only way to get in contact with the customer service is via email which can take forever for a response., Pay the drivers more money get actual person to person customer service via phone instead of email.

﻿Working at Uber, The people I work with really support me and help me grow. The food snacks relaxed atmosphere and the chance to work with a well known brand., Very minimal but the food can be a bit healthier and a better gym partnership (if any)., From experience from my TL encourage your agents because they will love that.

Acceptance rate doesn't make sense since its a partner based job, Help us drivers enjoy driving for Ubereats getting 3 dollars for a 10 dollar gas bill drive is obviously a huge killer. Gas Cards are only issued after 100+ trips every month but don't take accountability on how much mileage you drive.

They offer no support do not help you find areas to drive in (ignore the surge if you drive for them- never ever profitable). Wear and tear on your car gas adds up fast and Uber pool can actually cost the driver to complete. If you want to be..., Stop lying to people to get them to drive for you by advertising false and unattainable hourly wages. Get rid of uberpool or at the very least give the drivers a fair wage from it instead of lining your own pockets. Oh and if you’re going to take half of the cost of the trip right off the bat maybe let riders know that so they don’t assume a driver made $13 off a trip instead of the $4 we actually get.

Phone support (as in the ability to call someone) should be available. Perhaps a regional manager as opposed to a support hotline.

﻿Scam artists, Able to turn on the app and work any time, You make less than minimum wage after costs High risk Management treats you as a second class citizen Toxic culture with no integrity, Try driving for Uber *for a living* for a few months with no additional income. Then go back to your job and change everything.
﻿Not wroth doing it, You are your owe boss you can setup you owe schedule. You get to know more people. you will know more about the city in and out., Not making money siting in the car for 13 hours not even making 130 per day and you have to pay for your owe gas., The price should be more higher
﻿Uber Employer Review, Flexible hours Uber rider credits, Low pay online meetings minimal communication with management, Provide raises
﻿If you're desperate, Self managed and you can drive on your own schedule, You get a VERY poor cut of what Uber charges the passenger., Take less and give the driver more of the monies collected especially in lower fares and where there are not a lot of riders.
﻿Uber Brand Ambassador, The managers seemed to be very genuine and good people., The program was scrapped without notifying employees. We were kept in the dark and after several follow up emails they decided to tell us we're not working for them., Look to hire people only when you're sure you need them. Otherwise you're just wasting everyone's time.
﻿Drive, None- They are using and abusing your car and time for their pure profit per ride, Everything....Some rides actually cost you money to accept...RUN and find something else. They are using drivers and their cars. Your lucky to make $5 an hour, PAY DRIVERS WAY MORE....NOT LESS.
﻿Uber Partner, Support can be less than helpful at times which can be very inconvenient in this position. Time off the road is $$ lost for the driver., Keep up recent promos & boosts for drivers due to discount for UF students,

﻿Software Engineer Intern, Good compensation and good work space with ecxcellent working environment and friendly co-workers., There may be come politics going on in the company wide which makes the future of the company a little obscure but if you still have a dream you should have a try. Remember it's still the largest unicorn and a pre-IPO company., my internship is too short to give any advice
﻿Much better than I expected, Despite intensive press coverage of the company (not always positive as you might have noticed) from inside this is a very convenient/inspiring place to work at. What I like: - competitive compensation. I've been working at many places and sometimes my employers played Scrooge McDuck on annual performance reviews (some of them are still searching for "replacement" all these years). At Uber in contrast I faced..., - Workload is high. Plenty of challenging and demanding tasks. I'd say that work/life balance is shifted towards "work". - I'd prefer more spacious offices., Keep going as is.
﻿Problems with Uber Ratings, You are able to set your own hours., The biggest problem I found was that customers complained about everything. For example my car had a standard transmission. I had a couple of customer complain about me revving the engine. With a standard transmission you have to some to prevent stalling out the engine. The problem is that the company will give you a warning when your rating fall below a certain point. But it is just a standard video that you watch on..., Tell your drivers what exactly they are doing wrong so that they can correct their mistakes.
﻿Marketing Manager, - Working in a world class team learning from some of the most brilliant minds. - Being part of an innovative company that is changing the way cities move and the way people eat - Benefits are really good - Everyday you feel as though are making an impact, - Fairly time demanding it's hard to switch off from work - Dealing with constantly being in the media spotlight, 
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule. Sole Proprietor status., Questionable earnings. Inability to forward concerns to upper management levels., Be more interactive and responsive to workers.
﻿Marketing, Amazing company you will solve problems which no one has ever solved, You need to hustle a lot, 
﻿Uber is Wunderbar!, - This company gives their employee ownership of the company! I feel like my manager/supervisor is trying to help me grow as an employee and in return I want to help Uber Grow - The culture of this startup is just that. I love the start up feel but I can tell Uber is trying to learn and grow into a company people can be proud of. - You wear many hats at this company therefore I feel i am bettering myself and learning..., Being a 9 year old company Uber still has some things to iron out - "change is the only constant" I don't mind change but i can see why this could be a hindrance to certain people. Uber is finding a way to be a company that is enjoyable and efficient but because of that its a lot of trial and error, 
﻿As good as minimum wage, You work whenever and wherever you want (in your city). If you don't mind driving it's an easy job to do., Long hours online and driving to make minimum income. Risky since you are on the road all the time. Not good for your health as you are setting most of the time., Consult with your seasoned drivers before making changed to the app.
﻿Hmmm, Great job low pay just a way of life if your lazy ijs, Low pay people giving wrong addresses, Increase pay show more concern for workers
﻿Contractor, The hours are flexible and you eventually get ride credits, There's much confusion and miscommunication among teams, Open the lines of communication between teams
﻿Driver, Pays all the bills. I can't complain., Nothing I can think of, Keep up the good work
﻿Life-changing and inspiring. Best job on Earth., Growth opportunity innovation and brilliant progressive people. Perks include Uber credits catered meals bonuses and swag. You want to work here. Trust me., Can be as stressful and time consuming as you let it--it's up to you to resist such temptation. Strict NDA and a constant target for negative media., Keep up the good work!
﻿The Worst "Job" I've Ever Had, - "Flexible" - Instant Pay Option, I don't even know where to begin with this. I guess the first thing to talk about is the pay. The pay is HORRIBLE. You are getting a whopping $1.15~ per mile and about 14 cents per minute that's before Uber's 25% cut. This may not seem so bad but once you factor in wait time (more on that in a minute) how many miles it takes to get to the person you are driving and miles put on your own car you are not even making..., Advice to policy makers crack down on this company BIG TIME. They are misleading about how much you "make" and after costs employees aren't even making minimum wage. Advice to Uber: Pay your employees $3.50 per mile 50 cents per minute and cut down on wait time by 75% and this MIGHT be worth the hassle for drivers.
﻿DO NOT SIGN UP!!!, Working when you want but you do get paid what they say you'll get so it's definitely not worth it!, EVERYTHING is a con about working here!!!! They cheat you out of your money like CRAZY !!! Then when you ask for them to adjust the pay they have all the EXCUSES in the world on why they cannot give you the correct pay adjustment! Everyone says something different each time. Also if you are waiting AT a restaurant and they are taking all day to cook the food it falls on you and you get an email saying how YOU need..., Pay the CORRECT amount! Get everyone on the same page where every help support is saying something different.
﻿No managment, Great food and benefits Get to work with cool tech, No management they are throwing money at a problem and they do not listen to employee input., 
﻿Uber, Good co-workers. Provide snacks and beverages., No growth in career. Experts with skills are not properly appreciated.,

﻿Work here!, Friendly understanding will work with your schedule, Pay is not consistent, 
﻿Sometimes it's not worth the ride, Meet great people  east side job with no incestmebt. Make your own hours . Get paid instantly, Long drives to pick up the passenger who goes only a couple miles. $3.50 earned. 15 miles and gas spent just to get to the low fare . Have to drive army least 10 hours a day to make a living, Raise fair and include driving to the passenger in the equation. Minimum ride should be 5$ at least
﻿UberX Driver San Diego, You select your own hours surge pricing is profitable, Car gets dirty quickly riders could sometimes act rude, Higher base pay and mileage pay
﻿Great experience highly recommended. Love to see my fellow xooglers flocking to Uber!, Culture changes Focus on productivity Great team morale Pay & Equity Equality Community Focus, Lots of leadership changes (a positive too) Lack of spot bonus / kudos bonus, Hire our world class CEO quickly continue on the path to Uber 2.0!
﻿driver partner, quick cash in your pocket when you need it, worst customer service than comcast. no human beings available. canned cut n paste responses to emails, have some consideration
﻿u b er b ad, time freedom choice set ur own schedule, awful management dangerous satressful sore bacxk, listen to drivers not just customers ditch rating system learn NVC
﻿Don't Do It  Find something else, Fast cash dictate own hours, Rude riders/customers disrespectful customers customers vomiting in your car customers leave garbage in your car disrespect of your property too many short rides where you make around $3/ride too much down time between rides hours are very long (around 10 hours) market is saturated with drivers so you're lucky to make $100/ 10 hour shift Wreaks havoc on your car expensive filling up gas tank., None because you'll still exploit your drivers while taking 25% of every ride
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule. Great interaction with all types of interesting people., Often had issues with collecting payment., Be more personable. Many of the conversations are just preprogrammed responses that do not typically answer your specific questions.
﻿not the Uber experience i wished for, - nice people to work with - food in the kitchen, - definitely not a good choice for experienced employees the "shenanigans" that are going on there can be the main reason to quit - there are many examples where the labour law was breached without even knowing - HR team have the slowest response times i've ever seen in an international company they need more that a month to respond and that's quite promt with them - lots of young people without according work ethic..., - think 3 times more before choosing team leaders - try to hire more people with experience that CARE and want to change how things work
﻿To many low fares, Work whe you want to, Cheap fares not many tips and to far away thecapp sucks, Fix the app stuip people who cant put in therigth address in thris town
﻿Not worth it, Be your own boss. Meet interesting people., Ridiculously low wages and eroding opportunity to make weekly "Quest" bonuses. My current quest bonus for the week is 20 rides for a... wait for it... a whopping $15 (fifteen) Dollar bonus!! I used to get at least $100 Quest bonuses. Can't make the job in any way profitable anymore., UBER is going to suffer from employing desperate drivers who live in their cars if they don't find a way to compensate drivers better... especially in markets like NY and SF.
﻿Community Specialist, Bad management style and horrible internal office politics, Get more organized, 
﻿Completely non-transparent, Great benefits great pay Uber credits every month., Complete lack of transparency especially regarding over 500 employees being laid off., If you promise transparency hold to your word.
﻿Uber is a fantastic employer, The technology that Uber are building is world class---they go out of their way to solve the real problem to do the hard work to solve the correct problem no short cuts. This is really exciting a really exciting place to work., The reputation. It's entirely outside the company and influenced by the media and the less-informed perceptions and rumours circulating through the community., 
﻿My nUber experience, Free Uber rides food snacks plus the awesome team/people I work with. The management itself is open to discuss any suggestions and they take feedbacks from their employees which is a good practice to build a great working relationship., Have to be careful whenever we go out of the office cause most people will ask so many questions about the company about Uber etc. whenever they saw or hear that we're working with the company., Keep up with the transparency with how the company is doing month per month. The town hall sessions that we do is a great way to involve everyone in this business.
﻿Best Company, allows you to grow as long as you keep producing good work. Smart people all around you that you can learn from. Great Perks Awesome Co-Workers, Distance from home office is an issue., Keep doing a great job on benefits and open discussion. This is key to longevity and commitment to the organization.
﻿Review for software engineer intern in Uber, Many interns have got return offer and the pay is for intern is really good., The return package for a full time employee is not large., 
﻿Uber Eats representative, Free food. But they had no qualms about feeding the temporary staff what was comparable to dog food., No ethics whatsoever. They dangle the "employment carrot" without any sincere desire to offer employment. They don't care about restaurant owners and seemed to not care when restaurant owners felt 30% was too high. The company is weirdly full of people who throw around buzz words that they picked up. So "hustle" "swag" and a bunch of other ridiculous words are thrown around to rally up morale when going into the office..., To give advice means I want them to thrive but I think the world would be a better place without Uber. So keep doing what you are doing!
﻿Tired, no boss no schedules, work not consistant its like a server job u have good days and bad. to many hours driving to make any kinda money., raise the rates for the drivers so that they at least make money driving to find riders.
﻿Stay Away From Uber/ All Ride Share Co., You can make your own schedule, Low pay Rude Riders Busy only at peak times. Rest of the day make no money., Give drivers a larger percentage of the fare during the slower times of the day (10-4). Increase Driver percentage of fare overall. Cost of living has gone up for us; your company makes millions share the wealth!
﻿Uber Expert I - entry level of a customer support expert, I love the people I worked with. Uber takes great pride in the kind of people they hire. Also at the GreenLight Hub there is a lot of freedom to explore the company to find your niche, The work can be a bit monotonous., On the internal side of things there needs to be a lot more communication and clarity on polices that we have to abide by.
﻿Senior Marketing Intern, , , 
﻿Expert, Great company with lots of opportunities, You need to have a lot of patience dealing with drivers how blame everything on you., Increase salaries
﻿Honestly - A great place to work., This honestly is a fantastic company for multiple reasons: - I feel extremely welcomed by the team that I'm on. They care about me help me and mentor me in all ways. This extends to the office that I work in as well - every single individual in this office is very easy to talk to and all are so passionate about their work. - I feel that the work that I do has impact. The technology worked on here at Uber literally..., I don't get a bus pass but that's not a big deal. I get Uber credits instead! We get bad press but it's helping us grow and improve for the better., You're all doing amazing work - I'm very happy with what the Executive Leadership Team has accomplished in the past 6 months and I'm so proud to be able to work here. The communication has been clear consistent and very honest and I appreciate that so so much. Huge and special shout out to Liane - you are an inspiration and I hope to be able to shake your hand and thank you in person one day for all your hard work and...

﻿Sr Marketing Manager, great company hyper growth learning oppportunity, culture work life balance comp, 
﻿Not a real tech company., High salaries big financial opportunity with equity., Politics-heavy environment. Quality of work is absolutely secondary to personal exposure. Incompetence rules. Every small office does whatever they want how they want it at the only advantage of the local despot., Fire a good 70% of the current workforce. You don't get such a mess back on track with the same people who derailed it.
﻿Waiting to get paid for a week now, At first it was cool didn't have issues with getting my money, Will no longer drive for them. Been waiting to get paid for a week now. Customer support is a freaking joke., 
﻿Good for students, Your own boss your own time paid weekly., Wear and tear on car., 
﻿Depends on your team, Exciting product and mission passionate co-workers., Poor work/life balance teams rewarded for short-term wins resulting in more flashy than substantial outcomes. Lack of diverse perspectives., Work toward greater consistency in employee experiences across the different teams.
﻿Always changing gradually pats less and less., Not having a boss fun meeting people work as much as you want. The app is always making good improvements, Pay varies from month to month. Lots of costs to running the business. bonuses are gradually shrinking. They don't update city specific laws, No management.
﻿Uber, Fast paced and lots of opportunities of learning and personal growth if you know what you want, Current media perception and lacking direction from leadership, 
﻿they don't care of you, you can work whenever you want, working as a slave whenever you are on, Management team is not really necessary for this type of company
﻿Not sure what is being asked in this field, Competetive Benefits and Culture Site location, can't think of anything as of this writing, 
﻿Hard on the body but enjoyable, easy quick money. on your own schedule, bad for your body. takes a toll on your car, add more help options when something goes wrong with a rider
﻿Was expecting more opportunities.., Missing communication about careers opportunities. out of the blue you'll have some position...like it was for for yesterday!, Some managers are lacking of experience & maturity to be able to deal with stress & communicating in a fairly way with team ..., 
﻿Brand Ambassador, , , 
﻿Uber cool UBER!, Dynamic working environment super helpful colleagues great perks!, U need to be really high on energy. A Sloth can never survive here., 
﻿Analyst, Work can be a challenge sometimes and deadlines are pressing but the work is rewarding, Brand is difficult, 
﻿Center Of Excellence, Relax workplace Free Meal Cool office, Because of the company's leniency some employee are abusing it., Should have a survey for TL's and SME's so that you'll know if they really are doing their jobs.
﻿Great culture and transparency in work, 1) Wonderful peers to work with ( Your learning curve skyrockets after having worked with such terrific people) 2) a lot of hustling happens everyday 3) Everyone come and goes happy to work due to the open culture and freedom given by the managers. You feel the ownership of any work that you are given. There are no specific career path for contractual employees but people do get promoted to full time employees..., Not have felt any as such obviously some problem does exist everywhere but management is always working on to curb the problem and listens very promptly to employees advice., 
﻿Expert 1, Uber has changed my life changed many peoples lives only for better. The team dynamics brings worthiness to someones life, I yet to comment on this, 
﻿Experiences of being a Uber employee, Uber is the first company I've worked on where you really care about the fact that you are what you are without it being able to harm you as a professional. Since the foundation for the company to grow is to have its employees lavish creativity and love for what it does., I think Uber could have some program in selections to increase racial diversity. I'm black and in Greenlight where I work I feel little represented. Brazil is the country where the population is 55% black. Diversity is accurate., At the moment I have nothing to talk about. Management is ok.
﻿Best place to work!, You can be who you are and you know meritocracy is followed as a guarantee. Great people co-workers and values., I can't think about anything to put here., 
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Sales Director, Young dynamic company with some room for potential growth. Incentives could pay off if you can stick around long enough, Leadership is horrible. Lacks proper on boarding. It seems like their growth targets are too aggressive and they do not have the ability to keep up with them, Pay attention to what your employees are saying. Invest time in creating better processes and systems. Spend resources on proper training and on boarding for your new hires
﻿UBER DRIVER, You have the opportunity to meet new people and form conversations with them. The hourly rate range from $10-25 an hour., Some days are busier than others so the amount of customers you get is undefined. Sometimes customers don't respect your car and treat it like a cab/taxi., 
﻿Improvement needed, Fast money weekly pay great conversations, Must idle time waiting in-between rides. Frequent cancellation in San Antonio area due to some discriminatory riders., Uber driver review - I enjoy driving/riding for Uber. Its a convenient fast way to get around San Antonio. I believe Uber could improve on the driver app end. As a driver most of my riders are great never had a problem. I notice some riders cancel their request after seeing my profile. I have a high star rating. I am a man of color. I have a newer modern clean vehicle. This has happen too frequently to be any other reason...
﻿Amazing opportunity!, Inclusive team so many opportunities to grow and develop both within your team and outside of it. Surrounded with brilliant minds fun work and a great office space. Worklife balance is also great., Public perception of the company (which I haven't found any validity in yet!!), 
﻿Account Representative, , , 
﻿A roller coaster, You can set your own hours. You can choose what platform to drive and you could meet a lot of interesting people., Not enough pay no benefits very greedy only looking out to make money not looking to establish a better rapport with driver's and their Riders not looking to close that Gap on the price of uberX Uber XL not looking at the Long Haul of gas prices on the rise maintenance on the driver's cars. Most importantly they have no relationship or regards of Common Sense for the drivers or their consumers., You really need to step outside of the Uber box and look at your drivers out here building a multi-billion-dollar company for you. Because without your driver's or your consumers you would not be worth 69 billion dollars on paper. Sometimes greed-is-good but obridge greed that's not good at all. You need to pay your drivers you need to have a better benefits plan for your drivers you need to have a better relationship...
﻿Great place to work and grow as an Engineer, Awesome engineering challenges and unlimited vacations., Compensations & Benefits are mostly in stocks instead of cash, 
﻿Part-time driver for Uber, You are able to work your own hours and as long as you want., It is difficult to know exactly how much you're going to make a week., 
﻿Uber Driver, Not stressful job good environment easy to work no experience required, A very demanding job if you want to gain good, 
﻿Driver 1. 1/2 year, You can do your own schedule, Your rating goes down on email of any stranger. Fraud you explained C paid $30 D got $16 Uber 25% is their share but driver 12 miles time an hour drive LA 0.6 miles and 0.11 min $16 but the 25% is $8 service from the 30 dollars not $4 than a booking fee of$2 and $4 customer fee ?What you think? Fraud the own drivers.! I didn't realize till I got like crazy hours to drive not only 6 till 8 hours. Rating unfair get..., Rating is unfair and belongs not to the public domain. I would like put some question for the riders to save are you got picked up and drop off on your location and put the rating on the base questions not let the rider choose
﻿CSR, GM is a good woman., (my review is 2 years old these may be solved) - no travel&food expenses paid - no overtime payment and you work nearly 24/7 - job is too much for one person - you are external and you stay one forever they also make you a limited time agreement. - turnover rate is extremely high people usually manage to stay for one agreement term. - don't expect going higher in this position. you'll stay as CSR. don't know..., - hire 2 CSR instead of one - don't hire overqualified people for this job. you only need english&people skills not an astrophysics phd.
﻿Worked for the corporate side, , , 
﻿Love working here!, I love working at Uber! This company is thriving and they are RESILIENT. I work with a small group of people and they're all super professional and supportive. I absolutely see a future here and I can't wait to see what happens in the future. Also they offer great healthcare., I work a 30 hr work week which is considered "full-time" but I wish I had 40 hours it's honestly something that I debated before taking the job., 
﻿Team Work, Uber is the good place for Fresh Graduate to learn more about business of technology. we are challenged to face the problem and find out the solutions as fast as possible. we can learn more about how to treat others wisely. as a team we also learn how to engage with team for achieve high performance., There is still a lot of wasted time many employee who do nothing at some times. Sometimes i have wasting time if my task is already done., We can do better if we can engage each other. Team work in Uber Bandung still need to improve. not every single task must be explore by ourself sometimes we need our employeer to direct us as an intern employee. But i believe Uber bandung will be better to the next .
﻿Uber Driver, Able to work to your schedule You can make money if you need it at any time, Sometimes you have rude passangers, None
﻿Smart co-workers hard-driving culture, -Very data driven company where numbers and logic rule -Talented hard-working co-workers -Great working environment (offices perks benefits etc) -Lots of fun at work. Exposure to many different types of functions., -Progression is very difficult. Everyone is ambitious and they need more "doers" than managers -Aggressive culture - could use a bit more discipline and checks/balances, Professionalize the culture and decision-making process
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule. Decent money. Good riders for most part., No phone support. No real complaints, Keep moving in the right direction.
﻿3rd month performance and personal review, I am very glad on how the management treat the employees with regard to culture and environment, there are times when updates regarding process and policies being implemented without prior notice, Keep doing what we do and let us exercise emotional intelligence in every decision we make.
﻿Not really worth it..., Work whenever you want instant payout., The pay is terrible. Usually less than minimum wage and thats not including gas. 95% of customers don't tip. I work for other platforms (DoorDash Postmates Grubhub Caviar) and this is by far the worst one. The only thing going for it is the instant payout., Don't screw over your drivers. With so many other options out there people quickly realize that this isn't worth it in the long run.
﻿Partner, Flexable not a long commute to work, I was harassed often by riders Riders made requests that would endanger my safety as well as other motorists on the road. I felt as through l was driving in fear many college kids threatened to have me disactivated even through l was doing what l was supposed to do . I never felt this vonrable at any job. This was not about a trip from point A to Point B it was about fulfilling an arbitrary acpection from millinials...., Listen to the driver when thier concerned just because someone complains doesn't mean thier doing something wrong.
﻿Good enough, Good place to work started to increase base salaries introducing company phones etc. Change perf review removed notorious stack ranking., Still not clear when to ipo no clear plan to ipo not sure if Rsu can be turned into real money, 
﻿This is the best job i've had so far!, Very nice and warm environment full access to management & leads  support from co-workers ability to learn and move up the company No hovering or micro managing, Nothing i can think of, Keep doing what you're doing!
﻿food delivery driver, I can handle my time, The payments are very low, Incentives to customers to give them better tips
﻿Designer, Work life balance great people below industry average egos, High growth and speed are at times counterproductive, 
﻿Full time driver, Leasing a car from Uber that you get to drive even when you are not driving for Uber. I also like the Uber fuel rewards credit card they just came out with. That helps alot since I'm filling up every morning. The best thing about Uber is the freedom of working your own schedule. Love it so far., Being away from home every week can get tough if you are not use to it. The other icon for me is the amount of money I have to pay to lease a Uber car, I like the promotions but sometimes 60 calls over the weekend is high. Id like to see some smaller promotions too. Lots of navigation errors would like to see a change updated navigation faster routes that routes that take you on ridiculous routes. What would be great is a place for Uber drivers to go like rest stops that had bathrooms and something to eat.
﻿Great place to work especially for self-directed motivated people, + Incredible learning opportunities + Supportive team environment + Never a dull moment, - Difficult to find your footing if you're not a natural self-starter - Not all processes are in place or very clear, Continue to focus on re-building the company's values and mission. Listen to employees and keep them involved as you have started to demonstrate in recent months. Great work!
﻿Uber is not what it could be., You make your own schedule., 25% of pay to Uber, You do not need 25% of my paycheck all you do is provide the app.
﻿Designer, Work life balance great people below industry average egos, High growth and speed are at times counterproductive, 
﻿Full time driver, Leasing a car from Uber that you get to drive even when you are not driving for Uber. I also like the Uber fuel rewards credit card they just came out with. That helps alot since I'm filling up every morning. The best thing about Uber is the freedom of working your own schedule. Love it so far., Being away from home every week can get tough if you are not use to it. The other icon for me is the amount of money I have to pay to lease a Uber car, I like the promotions but sometimes 60 calls over the weekend is high. Id like to see some smaller promotions too. Lots of navigation errors would like to see a change updated navigation faster routes that routes that take you on ridiculous routes. What would be great is a place for Uber drivers to go like rest stops that had bathrooms and something to eat.

﻿Uber is not what it could be., You make your own schedule., 25% of pay to Uber, You do not need 25% of my paycheck all you do is provide the app.
﻿Community Operations Specialist, Uber credits Free meal Nice office facilities Hi-end equipment for work, Too far from convenient stores, 1) Keep aiming for high scores but never compromise the quality of each work. 2) Strategize for long-term action plans and avoid band-aid remedies. 3) Engage employees (more) to different activities involving the company to keep away ourselves from being burnt out of hitting our targets. 4) Update our knowledge base.
﻿Standing Strong, 1. A fun team and supportive working environment that entrusts you with a lot of autonomy to do your work. 2. The work feels rewarding because you get to deliver real business impact and be accountable for it. 3. The company is focused in its mission in delivering a solution that makes urban mobility better., 1. The on-boarding process is slightly disorganized at this moment which tend to leave new employees at a lost. 2. Company's current PR standing is not for the faint-hearted. Negative press coverage almost every other week. 3. A lot of work still to be done on the HR/ employee management front as trust needs time to build., Goes without saying. Go for and hire an awesome CEO CFO COO and CMO.
﻿Uber X Driver, Being your own boss working whenever you want., Hauling around underclass society who go short hops around the"hood". And not many people tip no matter how good you are to them., When you see the driver has alot of 5 star ratings and one customer has a gripe why would you believe them over the driver with all those 5 star rating's?? Think about it just means that person was a joke and they know it!
﻿Taxi Driver, The flexible hours here are great. I can work on my own schedule., There is a higher competion of uber drivers and there are days were work declines., n/a
﻿Driver, Immediate hire after background check., Quit fast modern day slave., Show faces and come behind Matrix. Hands on with employee's.

﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Lot to learn always hustling., Better work culture cool office environment aggressive working style managerial support., Future opportunities creation payouts can be better accept talented and not experienced people prioritize internal staff over externals during hiring., 
﻿Customer Service Lost, Customer service is terrible The way they sign you up You can get pushed offline randomly, I was driving did everything you guys wanted inspection interview wtv I was driving for about a week then I get a text saying submit your 4c if you want to keep driving? No one can explain properly I just deleted my account screw uber I didn't need it anyway was just curious ...., 
﻿Driving for UBER, Getting a steady weekly check is great! I love the flexibility of making up my own schedule. I drive when I want and when I want. I am my own boss., Wear and tear on my vehicle. Some riders are not nice and expect 5star service but when it comes for them to help a person out they don't even tip. The apps used for navigation often lead me to a dead end. Picking up drunk people after concerts and bars is getting old., There needs to be a better navigation app and you should spend some good money on it.
﻿Driver, Flexible hours. Work anytime I want., Low fare rates. Some times I only have one rider after an hour waiting which makes income extremely low., Increasing fare rates could attract driver to work more.
﻿Expert, I'm free to choose how i spend my time what projects do i want to be in. I can approach absolutely anyone that i want to. I'm learning and reaching things that didn't even knew that was possible., Actually as cheese as it sounds i have nothing to complain. Everyone is so supportive so cheerfull i'm sorrounded by inteligent capable and nurturing people. Today i reached the 3 moths mark and my life changed in a way that i'll never be able to thank enough., 
﻿Best Company Ever, salary benefits and team experience, i don`t have nothing to complain, 
﻿Uber Expert, Great team very positive and supportive working environment, Some problems remain unsolved; handle drivers with attitude, 
﻿Good for exposure, Get a chance to work with IIM ISB & IIT passouts expertise, Growth is pretty much narrow., There should be easy way to convert from contractor pay role to on role if they have tremendous performance.
﻿Interesting side hustle., Rude/Drunk/Disrespectful riders slow times wear & tear on vehicle. A lot of competition and other Uber drivers. The app's navigation system is very annoying., Be pickier on riders., 
﻿Different Environment, great perks in the office, no one has time to mentor, 
﻿Account Representative, Great environment and people. It is a fast paced environment that is always exciting. If you have a great work ethic it is an awesome place to work., There are some uncertainty's as far as growth and job safety go. Overall great place to work while you are here., Create a legit career path for your employee's and create job security. Needs to grow into a legit company instead of a start up environment.

﻿Being a Uber driver in Fayetteville NC, When I calculate my earnings I usually make around $12 a hour on weekdays Monday through Thursday. Friday and Saturday I make around $15 to $26 hour. The weekend is very profitable! Sundays around $9 an hour, Hourly wage not consistent pay. Younger Customers can be irritating. Most customers are young and usually travel in "packs" therefore They expect you to allow 5 friends tall loud musclar men in your car at once., Make Customers state how many friends they have with them so I can have the option to cancel.

﻿Business Development, Great work environment provides unlimited PTO young and fast paced culture never a dull moment., Bureaucracy and overshadowed by top performers at times., Need to work on creating a strong cross culture environment

﻿Want to change the world?, The freedom to pursue and solve challenging problems unique to Uber. Having meaningful and tangible benefits to communities and humanity at-large., Being under the public microscope can cause our efforts/direction to be slowed and redirected beyond that of our internal goals., Continue to foster create improve our internal culture to reach Uber 2.0.
﻿uberx driver, its okay. the app sometimes does not work well but the pay is decent. If you drive a hybrid it's pretty good money. definitely good money as a part time side job, uber app doesnt work well sometimes. Sometimes you get to a location and the rider doesn't show up for a long time and you dont get paid for the wait period, 
﻿Having worked there for a while.. Uber:, , , 
﻿Good potential but really poor engineering leadership, Good learning opportunities for new engineers. Lots of latent business potential. Flexibility in moving across teams expands horizons Good benefits like 401k health insurance etc, Engineering leadership is very weak and nontechnical Attrition is high on teams like payments. The management team has not been able to hire top talent A really weak CTO non technical VPE, Find a real CTO. Empower engineers L
﻿One of the best companys to work for, The company offers full time employees many benefits., There are no cons to work for this company, 
﻿Miss, Its a big company which offers the opportunity to learn and gain more experience in the process., I'm disturbed by the fact that employees at uber do not have provident fund what happens when one leaves the company coz its not always easy to save., 
﻿Salary of an Uber Driver, Pick your own hours and location, Use your own car; crazy passengers; Uberpool is not fun., Get rid of Uberpool and compliments. There should be extra pay for airport and train station pick-ups. Protect your drivers.
﻿Restaurant Operations, Working environment and team culture is just amazing!, Working hours and compensation is not good. Tends to take away away much of your personal time., Keep up the great working spirit! It motivates us to do better at work
﻿Driver, You get to pick your own hours, Not clear how the earnings break down for Ubereats, 
﻿Uber X pay is low for what you have to do., low pay on x...x passengers can be very extra...need to upgrade to select to make it somewhat worth it..., Increase pay. Also need to screen some of these drivers cars... some are very beat up... not fair to us that keep our cars up., 
﻿Amazing opportunities abound at Uber, - Challenging interesting work. - Ownership of projects - Amazing international opportunities - Smart engaged coworkers, With such a fast paced business you'll need to be willing to set your own boundaries for a work/life balance., 
﻿Amazing purpose horrible management, Good salary benefits are improving purpose of really changing peoples lives, Lives can be changed within what company thinks it is ok. Horrible management horrible, Hire some real managers
﻿Rideshare Contractor, You're your own boss you make your own schedule., Unethical business practices. Theft of wages. Customer Support extremly bad through the app., Quite using the arbitration clause to break laws and cheating people.
﻿Driver, I can set my own schedule and work at my pace., A con to working Uber is not knowing where the dropofd location is before accepting a ride. Also the gps goes out frequently., Maybe rider passenger pictures would help.
﻿Not a bad place to be given the options out there, Lot of good ICs around. Depending on the team you can build and learn a lot. You can related to the mission of the company. Large business potential. Good benefits like food health insurance etc, Doesn't feel like tech people are first class citizens more like a PM centered place. Lot of incompetent senior manager and directors with limited prior experience promoted because of playing politics. This has become clear during recent turmoils: not many true leaders but tons of people who call themselves leader. Recent changes feel like meritocracy has been replaced by a bunch of people on the top serving kool-aid..., 
﻿Driver, Flexible Hours Fun Meeting people, Dealing with drunks and entitled college kids, Pay the Drivers better
﻿Good side money, work as you please could get lucky and get nice surge jobs that pay off, pay for all your expenses cannot see where you are going until customer is in your car., 
﻿delivery driver, great money and a chance to view all parts of the city, cant be online or working more than 13 hours, none
﻿driver, Fast Pace with friendly co worker, Ideal work with pay and benefit, Keep Up the wood work
﻿Predatory leasing schemes, They can get you in a car quickly. Ridesharing is actually enjoyable if you like meeting new people and learning the area. Instant pay is very nice., Directly lied to about discounting the lease after reaching a ride requirement resulting in unexpected charges and a whole ordeal. Terrible driver support despite attempts at appearances to the contrary., Do not sell services you cannot support or do not have. Do not let employees lie to people. Fix the toxic company culture and treat riders better.
﻿Driver, Set your own schedule is nice, I used to work for Uber then I realized that collecting cans and bottles around town would be more lucrative so I do that now. In all seriousness this is a terrible company to work for. They use vague wording to make you think you're guaranteed money and then you don't get anything. The compensation is absolute peanuts. I worked 10 hour days sometimes and made enough to refill my gas tank and buy some dinner. There..., Stop scamming people Stop guaranteeing fake money Pay drivers a working wage Let us talk to you on the phone
﻿Flexibility, Easy Work and Work when you want too. Meet alot of people who are excited to visit your city. Get paid daily., Not alot of work sometimes even on weekends. People can be very drunk and possibly make a mess in your car., 
﻿No complaints! Very easy!, Work when you want make what you want (in bigger metro areas) you're your own boss!, Literally none so far. Super easy!, None - You are your own boss
﻿good side income and many benefits, very good app interface and system is very smooth., sometimes i met people with bad attitude. lol, 
﻿no way to talk about customer low rating and explain or told why, get out of the house for few hrs work when you want meet nice people, if we give bad customer rating we to get bad rating no way to dipute reason for customer retaliation on poor rating. customer gets 24 hrs to rate after we do so its always a customer who wins and we get kicked for there false review, make the app so drivers can comment on a good or bad experience the fare had it may cut down on lies from customer so they never have to get us again have something where fare is held accountable for what they say give your drivers a chance to give there side of what is in play customers know how to minipulate
﻿Decent company that pays regularly, Flexible regular pay be your own boss, High competition no guarantee you will get paid well enough, 
﻿Growing Pains: No More Startup Hustle, - Exciting Products: Some of the most exciting problems to work on in one if the most exciting markets - Smart employees: Many over achievers is a great learning environment - Take care of employees: On the whole they do take care of their employees financially and in other respects - Mobility: Fairly easy to move to other geographies or other teams, - Huge growth in headcount: High growth led to confusion on ideal growth trajectories - Competitive Culture: Appraisals and promotions were fairly cut throat and visible to weed out star performers and put pressure on other employees - Autonomy: Initial autonomy over time reduced as more central and management oversight layers were added, 
﻿hard to make money, I got to drive my own car and pick up fares., bad pay bad business model., pay employment fees we are not subcontractors we are employee by law.
﻿Not worth it, Own schedule meet great people, Wage below poverty--min wage. Arbitrarily remove drivers, Not a viable way to make a living due to high cost of vechicle maintenance
﻿Horrible, You make decent money. SOMETIMES.... but not all the time uber likes to switch things in their favor a lot and don't really care about the driver, People being very rude people can rate your every move and if they feel like being an really mean person they could put you out of a job because they don't like you or just because they felt like it and they are having a bad day so why not ruin someone else's and uber will treat it as if they don't care about the driver they won't even try to fight for you they just have the fastest revolving door I've ever seen, Never work for this company it's shady and they have never treated any driver right most full timers have to work 18-20 hours a day just to make ends meat and they want you to work more... they don't care if you work yourself to the point of exhaustion they just want their money if you die it's not their problem they just know they have provided a good service for their customers by giving them a ride for 95 cents a mile...
﻿Love driving, I love driving and love the platform connecting drivers with riders, . ..my only complaint is that it should pay more... drivers should be guaranteed $30-40 per hour., 
﻿Uber Review, 1. Flexible Hours 2. Instant Pay 3. Interesting Clientle, Nothing negative from my experience!, Keep up the good work!
﻿Driver, I live the quality of service I'm looking for part time job, Nice I can manage my time  and I like doing that, 
﻿greed is terrible, there is flexibilty to work any time., company wide greed. In illinois Uber takes Half of your earnings no matter what county you work in., First and foremost stop being greedy and inconsiderate of your drivers needs and your riders wallets. Without the drivers/riders nobody on the upper end of business would make a cent. Programmers wouldn't have a job to go to. CEOs wouldn't have a mansion to go to. Without the drivers and the riders the folks renting bikes in navy pier would make more money in a summer than Uber would in years. Biggest piece of advice...
﻿MOST RACIST AND HOMOFOBIC COMPANY, Free meals and lots of overtime hours., Management does not care at all for you. They fire people if you complain about management., Managers are not capable to deal with people. Zero people management culture and not enough experience to deal with daily customer satisfaction.
﻿Drivers are just a number, You can get paid daily or weekly, You put a lot of hours and a lot of miles to your car to gain less than minimum wage. Every year Uber makes several cuts to the drivers pay while at the same time they (UBER) increase their booking fees, Stop exploiting the drivers. Implement a fair fare.
﻿Amazing work environement, Relaxing  open  free food and entertainment environment, Not too many. Maybe its hard to get the hang of some tools in the beginning because some things are not as clear, Make the trainings more specific country focused
﻿A good but brief time there, My bosses were very open in helping me and the perks were great., I didn't have enough time to form a proper opinion of my time there., 
﻿Driving for Uber is pretty fun actually, Destination filter helps pick up rides on the way home or to my other job. Fun to talk to people meet people from all different walks of life., Pay is not as good as when I first started. Waiting times between rides has increased., Better pay.
﻿Community Operation Specialist, 90% email support and I leave ner. That all., Very novice management staff and management style. BPOs has better way to run their operation and have competitive management staff., Select people who has enough knowledge and competitive status to manage the operation. But let see what will happen after a couple or three months from now.
﻿Driver, Is good in the Flexibility, there is not a good paid, Paid better
﻿Fun challenging and liquid work environment, Specifically at the ATG Uber has been a wild ride. There is ample opportunity to contribute and build the company in a way that fits your strengths. When you find a part of the business that you're interested in and needs help you have plenty of opportunity to take on new challenges. The work environment is liquid - there certainly have been a lot of changes over the course of the company but I strongly believe all..., The business is young and still finding its footprint in the world. While it often feels like your career is in a rocketship because of the nature of the work and business is fast-paced this can be frustrating in your career if you don't know what you're getting yourself into. Some people don't like a lot of change in the workplace and working in less structured environments., Keep giving regular feedback to employees at all-hands about important events going on related to the company. Employees don't like finding out about major news affecting the company through the media.
﻿Best job ever had !, Own boss make own hours put in the time and make killer $$$, Maintenance on car 1099’d etc, Raise the mileage rates back up pre January 2016
﻿IRT Specialist, Great benefits and work environment., Schedules are not flexible., 
﻿Recommended for a short time period for basic position, , , 
﻿Uber, Work your own hours meet great people explore the city. Meet interesting people I like adventuring around the city and learning new things, Vehicle maintenance constant changing regulations commuting to Toronto rush hour traffic annoying people costly meals etc I don't like cleaning the car so much, Take care of your full time long term drivers
﻿Expert I, -Exciting workplace -Fantastic coworkers -A satisfying work environment -There is always someone or something ready to help whenever necessary -I feel as though I can grow with this company -Pay and benefits (health and otherwise), -Dealing with people who are severely frustrated, Full-size water bottles in the break room.
﻿Driver, customized work schedule  flexible  social, low pay  wear and tear on vehicle  gas costs, increase per mile rates
﻿They're okay, You have your own schedule Don't have a boss Have the possibility of making pretty good money, You never know how much money you will make They are not always good at communicating with you when you have issues Wear and tear on your car, Make it easier to communicate
﻿Uber Driver, Flexable hours. Meet new people every ride, market is very over saturated with drivers, 
﻿Driver, flexible hours get to meet new people, less pay and more hours, 
﻿Marketing Operations, -Autonomous work at your own pace. Work hard play hard. -Flexibility with scheduling, -No clear career paths -Goals set by management are very vague -Many unhappy employees -For trying to have the "best" culture it is quite the opposite internally, 
﻿CommOps manager, - Career Opportunities - Autonomy and decision making ability - Travel opportunity - Meritocracy - Having a seat at the table - Do first and say sorry later culture, - Long working hours - Lack of work life balance - Does not pay very well - Culture can be overwhelming - It can be very competitive, 
﻿UBER Driver - DEPOSIT MISSING, poor communication  no problems other wise, I am writing Today because I am fed up with UBER this past week and half  because i have not recieved my deposit to my bank Account. They have no DIRECT PHONE LINE TO talk to an ACTUAL AGENt to reslove this issue . Ive been sent a trace id to have my bank trace . MY bank was unable to trace the deposit. Then I notice that that information they sent me to confirm that have deposited into my account is incorrect. Now I..., 
﻿Driver, Make extra money on your free time., Uber takes half your fare. They dont give money for gas they dont do the driving they dont help maintain your vehicle. Company is becoming greedy and doesnt realize with out drivers they are nothing., Increase the driver compensation or watch your company slowly die due to your greed.
﻿UberEATS is pretty horrible., Switch the app to ONLINE and stay on as long as you please. You simply choose what hours you wish to work., The pay is definitely the main issue. An average trip takes 30min (15 min to pick up and 15min to drop off). Average pay for a trip is $4!!! Thats about $8/hr!!! Not including all the fuel you are wasting. Tips are seldom however thats a totally subjective issue...I'm no daisy when it comes to looks., Consider how long your drivers are waiting in traffic. Pay us more!!! $6/per 30min trip would be alot better.
﻿Great experience so far!, * people here are really smart and hard-working * we are solving some really unique challenges especially compared to other tech companies in the Valley * you really do have the opportunity to create impact in a real way. it's easy to take an idea and run with it - no one is stopping you * SF-location, * the negative press can get to you - it's constant * if you're used to a company where all the processes are up and running and there are robust systems and programs this is not the place for you * lack of leadership, We need to hire strong leaders and focus on building our reputation back up. This is a true watershed moment and if we play our cards right the Uber redemption story could be a model to other companies for years to come.
﻿Own a business, It's an opportunity to be your own boss and also it opens the door to small business funding and tax credits., Need to pay drivers a little more, 
﻿Opportunity, Lots of room to contribute how you want. Truly inspiring people. So much fun to work with drivers every day., It's not super fun when drivers vent about whatever situation they're going through - especially when you don't have the ability to improve it. It can be frustrating but worth it when you can help., Continue to change the world!
﻿It can get you money you need to pay bills but must put forth lots of time more than 8 hours at least., Opportunity for part time or full time  a little more freedom and time to do errands Your earnings can be paid instantly unlike other jobs where you have to wait an eternity., Stressful with traffic. Some customers think we have a spaceship traveling 1000 mph when the restaurant does not have the food ready when you get there. Also when the food place electricity goes off due to lightning or rainy conditions the uber system may or may not recognize you are even in the area ready to pick up orders and then the customer gives you a bad rating that affects your overall rating. Not fair at all...., Do not let customer rating affect the driver ratings as there are many factors that are not in the control of the driver.
﻿Somethings wrong, You get to work your own hours, Uber doesn't have number to contact support. Your pay posts to your account and on long trips uber pays you what they want. I had a trip and the trip paid 211.00 and the trip posted to my account and uber withdrew the trip and paid me 148.00 I screenshot the trip info and sent it to them and I am still battling them about it now. They are saying it is another amount which is a lie. Because their app posted this to..., We need a number to speak to someone in person in Mobile Al. And if we go by what the app says we get paid why change it like we are naive to a lesser amount. This us how lawsuits get started and trust gets broken between two parties. I am still trying to get my fare right but now since I have sent screenshots no one is answering me back.

﻿It is a nice company to work in, The company has a challenging enviroment, There are not enough career opportunities, 
﻿Great place to work, -Hot lunch & dinner -Competitive rate -Insurance -Fun intern events, I think the meal can be better. The quality of the lunch doesn't seem consistent. (It's really good sometimes and very under or over seasoned the day after) Also I wish the number of menu was more than now., 
﻿UberEATS Restaurant Operations Manager role, The greatest thing about the company is the incredible people you get to work with! Everyone is dynamic highly intelligent and ambitious. It's a great environment to be in., Expectation to work long hours., 
﻿UBER EXPERT, One of the best reasons to work for Uber is I get to provide people with proficient assistance. Another reason I enjoy working for Uber is getting all the benefits. I also appreciate the patience and how helpful my coworkers are., One of the cons of Uber is that there are not enough meetings and confirmed information., I am satisfied with management everyone is helpful and flexible.
﻿Predatory Company, -Flexible Schedule -Commission Rate for referrals can be high -Good pay during heavy surge times like holidays and large events., -Legally grey. Threatened by police officers with tickets many times. -Referral rates can change drastically. Too unstable to be reliable. -Not profitable to drive at the NJ base rate. -Your car will age very quickly. Potholes messy passengers constant driving etc, Find a way to pay drivers enough that they are more loyal to the company or replace them as quickly as possible with self-driving cars. Paying people as little as possible with trivial benefits doesn't make the company look good.

﻿Uber Driver, , , 
﻿Account Representative, Flexible Gym and Phone benefits, Pay is very low No sense of Direction, Leadership and Vision is Key
﻿Customer Service Representative, Amazing perks - benefits are super low cost and cover a ton of services. Excellent pay Snacks on tap - all day. Catered lunch and dinner Positive and productive atmosphere - everyone wants to be at work. Secure building helpful security Great view of phoenix, Everyone is always a little confused since it's still a baby company. Policies and processes are not efficient but the leadership is extremely transparent about everything., Let's work together - your CSRs have some ideas about what you're doing that might help you be more efficient.
﻿Great for retired/semi-retired., Easy work where you are your own boss. Great pay system with instance direct deposit. Good tax deduction for car expense offsets cost of gas., Dealing with traffic and LOTS of miles on your car ( about 20 miles per hour avg. over 10 months working). Weak support system but little needed., If we are "partners" input before taking on major chains (read McDonald's) would seem reasonable. Improve basic communication level with support.
﻿Happy, Flexibility of schedule. Ability to plan around work., Not steady enough income. No benefits., Be more communicative with employees.
﻿Uber driver, Get to network with new people every day, Example of my Saturday night: spend 8pm-12pn driving riders an average of 2 miles and 8 minutes per ride from outside of downtown and into it. Then back out to pickup riders in need. I make an average of around $2.89 - $3.33 per ride. I did 12 rides and made $48 dollars. Terrible pay no benefits and you risk losing your car in an accidentetc. Shame on Uber., Increase payout. Uber shouldn't take more than %10.
﻿Driver, Make your own hours that's it, They falsely advertise that you can earn money whenever you want however they've now come up with a whole bunch of stipulations that prevent you from disturbing your own money then sometimes they take your tips that the customers give you through the app worst company ever, 
﻿Partnership, The flexibility of time management and the convenience of vehicle ownership. Initially work environment and culture seem so don't be fooled., There's almost no welfare to "partners". I've seen pregnant "partners" told off that they can't help them if can't meet their vehicle fees., 
﻿NIce to work at spare time, you can make your own schedule, You always don't get happy customer, 
﻿Terrible Business Model - Customer pays just $5 delivery doesn't tip Uber makes $$ from restaurant and drivers, You're effectively paying Uber to deliver for them but during surge/boost hours you can make enough to eat meals and fill in gas ... that's it. In 8 hours working ONLY surge/boost periods called 'daily promotions' you'll make between $70 and $120 depending on your city your pings and the distances you drive. Now factor in gas mileage and depreciation and you're making less than 7 bucks an hour. BUT it's cash..., The whole business model is a con - a somewhat ponzi scheme. Uber charges the restaurant 30-35% of the order amount. Uber charges the customer only $5 for delivery - regardless of distance or the amount of the order. That's insane and explains why the customers are jerks ... they don't value the time and effort that goes into the pickup and delivery. They could be a rich couple in Bel Air or a single person living in..., It doesn't have to be this way. Why should a customer only be charged $5 for delivery when they live in Westwood and are ordering from Venice? Or if they order a 12 buck sandwich from Bay Cities or a gourmet meal from Sushi Roku for a 100 bucks? Customers don't have to spend time and money and battle the elements to go and eat at the restaurant. Charge them an amount that represents the value they get for having the...
﻿ATG Woman Engineer, I work at ATG--so the environment may be different than at other sites. I have a diverse team with a profile of experiences prior to Uber. I learn new things from my coworkers every day. I have a great immediate team and a good boss. Most of the people that work here are invested in the companies success. The market for self-driving vehicles is incredibly competitive and we want Uber to win. I am a woman engineer..., ATG will ignore important Uber initiatives by saying "We aren't a part of ride-sharing this doesn't apply to us". That can be frustrating especially when a program/training/experience becomes available to Prime and you feel it is important., Uber ATG is a part of Uber so please treat it as such. Hire more women. Hire more minorities. And stop using the excuse of "There aren't any qualified women (or other group)". Having an all-male team is a reflection on your hiring practices not the pool of candidates.

﻿My Experience with UBER Phoenix, Excellent Benefits start immediately Excellent Uber Perks/Credits monthly allowance Excellent Break Rooms free snacks and catered lunch Clean Offices Facilities Kitchens and Break Rooms Very Relaxed Environment with Friendly/Fair Management, Uber is a popular company many people will ask you what its like working there. Uber has had a lot of negative press lately. A very diverse group of people sometimes makes me nervous that I might accidentally offend someone., Please keep the benefits and perks we enjoy here. It makes people happy and it makes people look forward to come to work.
﻿Interesting & challenging work sincere and smart people, Most people I have met and worked with at Uber are smart and sincere. They really care about the customers and solving very hard problems which have not been solved before. There is no lack of challenging problems., Coordination between various departments is a challenge given the incredible pace of growth. Work is sometimes duplicated because of lack of communication., 
﻿Don't kill your time, I just kill my time with out wotking, No orders coming for pick up even in busy area, Sitting 3 hrs only picking up 3 orders in the busy area
﻿Uber- Xchange Leasing, - Above average pay benefits & perks for similar jobs within the Phoenix area. - Culture & environment highly enclusive. - Opportunity to create and work autonomously. - Ability to collaborate and partner with highly intelligent individuals. - Ability to drive an implement change. - Opportunity for growth personally and professionally. - Highly motivated team members and management staff. - Operational Excellence..., - Location of office in Phoenix., Continue to hire the best.

﻿Uber driver, flexible hours and get to meet interesting people, navigation system sometimes messes up big time, advise riders how to make sure pickup location is accurate
﻿Best way to get fast money, - Flexeble schedule. You can work whenever. Absolutely. - High salary -Weekly payments, - Sometime app work is too slow., 
﻿So far it's ok....., Be your own boss Set your own schedule Meet new people, Low pay Wait time for orders can be long Wear and Tear on your vehicle Few tips, I think an hourly wage plus tip minimum included for all orders will help.

﻿Uber Driver, work on your own time timely cash-outs good contractor support, occasionally issues with application but rarely a real issue, 
﻿Best place to learn and change how world operates, An immense amount of learning and independent decision making at a different level. We can do real changes in the cities if we believe in change and good customer service. Exposure to a super class team who take the business to a different level will develop the individual's personality and how we look at problems in the day to day life., Not found any cons as of now, Keep it up the good work we are under the spotlight since we are doing something different.
﻿overrated, work when you want to, are reliant on people rating you well may have to drive a lot to get back to an area where you can get rides a lot of sitting in one position with your arms locked have to drive drunks that may throw up in your car, dont be so super picky about people getting 5 stars less than 5 doesn't mean youre a bad driver just maybe not perfect which no one is. people can rate you higher because of your race. stop acting like this is such a great job to do it sucks and your app stinks. it keeps giving bad addresses
﻿Operations Coordinator, Close to Business Challenging problems and freedom to solve them. Great team. Truly global product and brand., Super quick decision making leads to anxiety before results, Hire more people.
﻿Uber review, Good culture and managment I guess., Need more information on whats happening, Give advice to youngters on career path
﻿Uber Driver, I like to meet new people., I don't think is any cons., I think the payment should be a little more.
﻿It isn't the dream that you thought it would be, People who joined early are smart and they work hard. The new breed especially management who live off the success of the grunts who did all the work not so much, too much internal politics it used to be about smart people and smart ideas now its about who can play the game this is particularly relevant to oversight from Singapore - heads of functions have no idea how to actually do the jobs they have been given completely out of their depth and dont like being challenged, get back to basics and make sure management understand what it took to be successful
﻿Software Engineer in Uber ATG (Advanced Technologies Group), Super smart kind thoughtful people super interesting problems benefits of a start-up and an established company. In my experience the media narrative just does not line up with the reality inside Uber. The people here are not "brogrammers" - they're serious software engineers that are passionate about solving a really really hard problem. This is at the ATG Pittsburgh location mind you so I can't comment on SF...., Mostly: the outside image. Explaining to your friends. Having to justify to friends why you support Uber and why Uber is a good company. But if you believe that fixing a problem that causes 30000 deaths and countless more accidents a year is important then come work at ATG., Keep up the energy. Things are moving in the right direction. Don't let the drive to keep ourselves accountable to our new values fall to the wayside when other priorities inevitably arise.
﻿Not bad but not worth it, flexible hours can get instant payout, tears up your car must drive many hours to make a profit, Give drivers more of a percentage of the ride costs let the driver know ahead of time the approximate location the rider wants to go.
﻿Not bad for a part time 2nd job, Work when you can and when you want. Pay can be great., Call center support for employees is horrible. I have had to fight with them to pay out over a mess a customer made a few times., Listen to your drivers!
﻿UBER on Brazil, Informal place good relation with superiors great coleages., The sctructure sometimes is not of the best., Put more effort on the buildings.
﻿Logistics Specialist, A very up beat fun atmosphere. Great PERKS! A progressive environment that is invested in the future of the company and its employees., Currently going through some leadership changes. Fast paced work environment., Keep allowing employees to help the company grow and work on filling the vacant roles in the leadership team.
﻿Very nice!, Great Benefits nice workspace and worktools (hardwares and online), We miss a resting room at Spots like we have on the HUB and pause times during job journey at Green Ligths, 
﻿You get what you put into it!, Make as much as you want to make based on hoe dedicated you are. This is a Self-employed business so you pay your own taxes and work when you choose. Meet tons of people from everywhere. I drive as far across the city as I want. From Lookout to Signal mtn to Soddy East Ridge Lookout Valley...There are perks fuel cars phone discounts insurance help discounts on tires services many kinds. Uber provides insurance..., It takes time to learn the busy places and hours. It does wear the car but based on how you choose to drive and take tax deductions. $0.53 per mile or depreciation and gas insurance etc. If you have a carry permit you cannot while driving for Uber., Riders ask me about easier ways to add things about the driver. They want more badge choices. City by city needs to post about things like open container laws and smoking/drinking alcohol in transit. Closer stations where Drivers can actually speak with other Support and experienced drivers. Things like CHA can be VERY confusing to new drivers!
﻿Uber Driver, Flexible hours tips nice people paid weekly, sometimes business slow no health insurance, 
﻿Driver/Partner, You can work as many hours as you like., It is not easy. You have to be patient and deal with people's personalities and urgent and sometimes strange requests., Give drivers more insight information to whom we are picking up.
﻿driver, , , 
﻿3 months experience, I use to work for Uber but as a third party. So now as a intern i feel much more appreciated. The main points that changed are: Benefits and salary increase, Sincerely I don´t have much to complaint, Continue the good work
﻿Operations and Logistics Manager, - Super fast paced - you can make a decision to do something and action it very quickly - Incredibly interesting work - Working with some of the most intelligent and ambitious people in the industry - An amazing sense of being a part of something - Great perks (food gym health uber credits), - Answering questions about all the press - Most people take a pay cut to be here but its opportunity cost and the work and people make it justifiable, Align comp to industry standard
﻿Uber doesn't Pay, Great benefits! Great experience!, Does not pay not even with the new pay restructuring. I'm supposed to making the middle of the pay range for a PgM. I'm not even close thank you GlassDoor for bringing that to my attention., 
﻿dribe, flexibility. sign up bonus no boss, crappy pay they try cheat you out of bonuses and pay sometimes, pay more its not worth working for you
﻿Tough enviroment, Free snacks daily lunch free uber credits. Very young atmosphere because there are a lot of younger workforce. Discount in gym., Working here can be overwhelming. There's a lot to juggle and there's rarely ever a minute where you feel on top of your work. Hard to get promotions here. The environment is stressful extremely intense. There is not much room for growth because career ladders aren't build out especially in the HR department., This advice is strictly for the HR team. Operate as a whole stop treating contractors so poorly and think about everyones contributions in the long run instead of ruining relationships.
﻿Legal and Tax Analyst, I feel part of company's objectives, Some processes need to be improved, I guess it is essential to have middle management trainings in terms of people development
﻿Misleading CL ads, Work when you want to, Market is way over staffed, Stop taking so long to listen to your drivers concerns
﻿acceptable, flexible hours no heavy lifting, poor navigation cant see reviews, pay more.
﻿Share my experience as Uber employee, I feel that I can help people the country is in financial crisis and Uber brings a way to make money and help the income of several families. My team is incredible they are always working out a way to facilitate and optimize the service to drivers not to mention that every day I am happy to have done a job that helps the community to grow and expand., I believe that the only one against which I have encountered is a local issue where we have some problems with the legislation I would like more responsibility to be honest., Come to visite us again. Will be nice.
﻿Great place for improvement and grow, Great culture respectfull place your ideas and expectation is important to the company and manager, really don't have any cons to consider here, 
﻿Loved working for Uber! Great pay! Optional hours!, Pros were interesting people and flexible hours. Could make up to $600 day on event days. As little as $50 on other days. Drive and money was direct deposit once a week., Inconsistent pay. Took a while to learn best driving times. Couldn't control pay but it was just starting in Oklahoma City OK, 
﻿Uber sign on bonus, You are your own boss. You set the hours days off vacation etc., The hourly way is way too low after expenses. The $35 per hour is very misleading. The sign on bonus advertised is absolute total fraud. I will pursue til I drop in the meantime badmouthing the company. I will not recruit any drivers after this., Have a contact number where a live person can be reached to discuss issues. Your drivers are your life blood. The turnover must be horrendous. You take care of the customers take care of the drivers too.

﻿Best workplace subject matters and people, -People -Ambition of the company -Work topics, -Having to defend the company at parties, 
﻿A great place to work, + free food + looooads of staff parties and opportunities for team building +work in the centre +modern office +Uber benefits +great atmosphere +career growth opportunities, not many - some markets have shifts but the managers are willing to make them comfortbale for everyone, not to change anything :) the management and the CEO are simply the best!
﻿An dinamic and inspiring place to work, I love being able to work in a company that is truly changing the way people understand their cities. Is great to work around truly passionate people who are ready to change the world. I had the opportunity to get promoted in the company within my first month., Some of the promotions are not in the "job and salary" but in tasks and responsibility. That's sometimes are very frustrating because you work twice harder than others to get paid even., Keep doing your great work. The company is getting bigger and with the growing comes the solutions of today "issues". Keep the feedback policies with it Uber will always grow better.
﻿Really young company, Young company A lot of freedom and autonomy Good payment and benefits Real chances of promotion, A lot of changes every week Not transparent, Talk more to the experts about the changes in the app so we are ready when a partner ask us about it.
﻿A great company, Good company with a pleasant work environment and many opportunities for growth., for the moments grows really fast and the proceses need a design., Improve the processes.
﻿Uber Expert, Salary Benefits Experience People Opportunities., Perhaps more autonomy and a better office location., 
﻿N'uber, Relaxed atmosphere Benefits and recognition Training People who are smart and willing to help, I do not have anything bad to report, 
﻿Staff Systems Engineer, Open culture best idea wins conductive to growth Friendly management, growing fast so there are redundancies for work old timers feel they own the place but that is changing fast as I see, Keep doing what you are doing
﻿Social Operations Response Team Agent CSR, Uber is very diverse and accepting. The company is not a hierarchy it's not a bureaucracy. Uber offers a lot of opportunities to its employees and the perks and benefits are outstanding. We are always striving to improve and what they say in the news is not truly accurate. I've never worked for a better company! My team lead and managers are great because they actually listen to you!, Nothing! I can't complain at all!, Keep doing what you're doing.
﻿Challenge opportunity to create and grow., We have the opportunity to make not only our business growing but also Celebrate the City. UBER give us challenges to learn new tools and seek excellence in your delivery. It is fantastic to work in a place where all staff seeks growth not only professionally but as a human being., The organization. We mostly care about is it But we know that living in expansion gives us this negative point., 
﻿Data Scientist, Horizontal movement is encouraged so changing teams is made easier, You frequently feel underwater but I suppose you get used to that, Slower is faster
﻿Praud Uber, Nothing to say. Bloody they don't deserve any rating, They are really cheating innocent drivers & they are working for uber growth only. Single driver is not getting atleast 5k in a month. How they will manage Thier families with very less amount. Yes they give business of 80k in a month. In that 25% uber commission diesel / petrol 25 to 30k if it is leasing ( initially we will tell the drivers 4954/- per week if they do 60 trips in a week. Actually we deduct 5954/- per..., Pls tell the truth before the attachment & don't chrat innocent people

In other words if people begin throwing up having sex insulting you throwing trash in your car or just being a bad customer you have to pretend to be totally happy with them or they will bomb your ratings and almost immediately have you suspended. It is as simple as receiving one bad review for reasons that are not even justified before Uber approaches you and speaks..., Pay the people who make your job possible more money.

﻿Driver, Can make your own hours, Adds miles to your car, 
﻿My first 3 months at Uber, - Amazing work Ethic - Stress on having fun while performing your duties - Surrounded by super smart people - Super diverse backgrounds from many industries and schools - Strong ownership by all employees, - Always connected very difficult to switch off, 
﻿Great place to work with great people., good pay with very good schedule., no overtime and remotely managed., Involved more often.
﻿Phenomenal opportunity to do great work, Great colleagues audacious projects fast moving culture. Kudos to Travis and management for being open to change and improving the culture., Aggressive - if you want a laid back culture not the right place for you., Besides Travis the CXO level is weak. Liane please keep working towards Uber 2.0. Great job!
﻿Worse job on earth, It is good just to time pass, Ruine yor car. Drive 200 km for 80 dolers plus u pay gas plus hst, Rating should not be in uber. How about some one is racist
﻿Good source of quick cash., creating your own schedule. opportunity to network. just a fun job overall., wear and tear on your own vehicle. not much guidance to start out., be more involved with your drivers.
﻿Uber lease exchange, Not putting miles on personal car., Uber leasing exchange reposed my vehicle after I inquired about process of returning car. I had my belongings in car including work laptop and had just put brand new tires on phone. I was never late on payment. Uber took an additional payment out of my account after taking car. Uber lease response; we can bring car back; not recognizing hardship their action caused. I filled a complaint : No live person to file complaint..., Staff at Uber exchange need more training. Need a live person to communicate with to rectify issues.
﻿Program Manager, Decent pay stock options Uber credits for rides and Eats encouraged to work and think independently., Company is going through lots of changes right now., Continue to have faith that employees can get the job done and help move the company forward.
﻿Driving for Uber, Flexible schedule not limited by a wage getting to meet a variety of interesting people., There is no minimum earning guarantee expenses are covered by driver no stock or health benefits because your a contractor., Raise the rates for the drivers and show them their time is worth more. Allow drivers stock options at least.
﻿Stop Whining And DRIVE, Punching your own time-clock. Same-Day Pay Interacting with different people all day long Out on the road all day long My Car/My Rules Independent Contractor = Take/Leave Jobs At Will, Complete lack of support for either client or contractor Lack of reciprocity across many state lines ( not necessarily Uber's fault ) Uber's discouragement of tipping ( If "up to the client" then STFU and let them ) Lack of an in-app tip option ( yes some clients have actually complained ) App only tracks "active" miles requiring the driver to use other apps such as EverLance to track and categorize all mileage. Maybe..., #1. Support...... Support.....SUPPORT !!! ( do something ANYTHING really ) Stay the course. Ignore the whiners who have NO clue about building market share nor how to deduct expenses ( judging by complaints here-in )......Nor what it means to actually BE an independent contractor in the first place ( like "YAY ! I can work whenever I want however I want but why doesn't the company pay for ALL my stuff tho' ???". Also;...
﻿Good part time job, The ability to make your own schedule and work whenever you want is very nice., Now knowing passenger;s destination before arriving. Tipping is not built into the app, Implement tipping as soon as possible and start listening to your drivers. It's imperative.
﻿Driver, Set your own hours get paid daily if you wish., Wear and tear on your car short rides waste of time can't make a living Uber does not care about drivers, Raise the fares and raise the minimum fare. Think about your drivers more.

﻿A tech company with nice office, Many drinks and food Can play table tennis and darts Energetic working environment You can have 2 hours lunch or even more, People lack discipline western office style doesn't match with the culture of Chinese. People can be late and leave early freely., More rules needed
﻿Freedom to make as many hours and money I like, I set my own hours, Wear and tear on my vehicle, Pay more to your drivers. We go though alot on a daily basis
﻿Skip to expect tipping you will work happy with UberEATS, Flexible schedule pay fare without tipping pick up location is close and always no need to wait for the foods., They cancelled a minimum wage per order so some times drive far to pickup but the customer address was very close and then I only got $3-5 and no tips. Waste time and gas. Some customers wanted to give me a tip but no cash., So far I am satisfied uber management. I see Tipping will coming soon on the driver app I hope that includes UberEATS because sometimes customer want to give tips but no cash.
﻿Change The World, Huge Impact: changing the transport & food industries with more planned. Everyone is empowered to do stuff even the junior folks from Day 1. Very intelligent people to work with and learn from. Good fun to hang out-of-hours too. Trips to San Francisco Singapore and Byron; ski trips to NZ!, The negative media [which is often unfair] gets you down sometimes. There is always another great project so it is hard to ever feel "settled." Compensation used to be low but that is largely fixed now. Hours used to be bad but this has got better., As the company gets big try to keep it feeling small like a startup - so we can keep building. More travel between offices to stay connected. More formalize learning too.
﻿Toxic, I find it difficult to pinpoint any pros at this company this may have to due with starting when 20 people were fired and then most of the executive board resigning. One would assume employees would take this seriously however this did not occur people complained about having to participate in diversity seminar while recognizing the fact that the company is all white and all male. In addition to the toxic company..., Toxic corporate culture. The recruitment process lacked honesty I directly asked if the temporary position (3-6 months) could be made permanent during the interview and I was told no. However on my first day I found that my position is still temporary but open-ended which has put me in a position where Uber can just let me go when they see fit. This wouldn't be as problematic if other people were not hired on during..., Recruitment process should be more honest. Work on diversity (gender race age).
﻿Not a place for long term employment, - Big name - Learn a lot - Smart people, - Too stressful - No work life balance - Cut-throat culture, 
﻿Analyst, Really interesting work inspiring teammates and a culture that sincerely wants to improve the world, Hacky and inconsistent processes unclear career progress, 
﻿Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Be part of the Uber family. Endless steep learning curve. Tons of room for your own initiatives into making the company better also if the initiative lies outside your function. Work with the smartest friendliest people in a company that is actively working with employees to transform into an example for other companies not just in terms of tech but also in terms of culture and HR., I don't see how I could work elsewhere where the total package could be more awesome than what I describe above. Perhaps if that would pay a lot then maybe because cash compensation is below market standards but then big part of your compensation is in equity., 
﻿Uber is Slavery, You get to work inside your car in the AC, Fares company culture customer support predictability structure management work ethics work incentives motivation., Stop cutting rates stop shorting people on batch orders or pool. Give more monetary incentives bonuses and boost on a weekly basis.
﻿Great but not perfect, Money is okay with enough hours put in and they seem to be putting drivers first right now adding tips and giving more of the base fare to us., Change is slow and online driver support is still weak...they seem confused very often., Create mandatory surge pricing during morning and evening rush hours. Start charging a fee for the time/distance it takes to get to the client... To sit in traffic in the middle of downtown for 15 unpaid minutes just to reach your client and then spend another 15 minutes taking them 5-6 minutes away and then receiving pennies for the work is pretty disheartening. Riders expect to pay a surge during the rush hours. ...
﻿Smart but robotic people, People are smart. Interesting problem space., Culture is toxic and change will take time., 
﻿Best place to be, Learning is endless but everyone is very supportive, Organizational structure as some people work for multiple post, None
﻿Driver, You can create your own schedule, Sometimes passengers can be impolite, None yet
﻿Amazing place to work with very smart and hard working employees., Solving the hardest engineering challenge since the moon landing project: self driving cars. Working with passionate very smart engineers possibly the best of the best in their fields. Fast pace inspirational high impact projects. Lots to learn. I have 20 years of experience and I cannot think of a better place to work as an engineer. Pay is very competitive potentially higher than major tech companies (assuming..., Some press does not seem to like Uber creating poorly balanced articles that do not reflect reality. This could affect some employees that care about press. Not a problem if you care about work environment professional development and solving challenging tech problems., Be more open with the press and show them how awesome is to work at Uber.
﻿Quality drivers and vehicles are drying up, You work when you want., Not enough profitable hours. Uber keeps adding too many drivers for the amount of customers so drivers suffer while riders and Uber benifit., Think about the rusting tools you are using to benifit your corporation and customers and wonder how long that model will last.
﻿Brand Ambassador, Bad communication from supervisors for certain events., To be more clear on the guidelines for projects, 
﻿driver, the app is easy to work and whenever your ready you can just turn on the app to start working., the pay is really low and we dont really get tips with the gas and the sometimes we have to pay for parking., increase the pay rate.
﻿Marketing, -great pay & commision opportunities -flexible hours & time off -work from home options -food catered daily in office -lots of projects and fast paced environment, -lots of management changes -high turnover -disorganized or forgotten/left behind projects -pay changes/scheduling from lots of hours to none -lack of communication between employees -favoritism over employees -tons of hours/work home life imbalance, Work on inner and upper communication don't work employees a ton of hours or burn them out. Recognize people who work hard and allow them to move up.
﻿A great place to work, The perks are great management is okay, for me there are no cons, 
﻿Driver, I like to work with uber because I work on my time, I don't get that many job alerts, Sometimes the amount you get paid isn't great for the travel time you do
﻿Great Place to Work!, -A totally different experience where you have something new to learn everyday! -It is full of very talented people -The Company has an out of the box mindset always open to new ideas to keep improving so that is also a way you can grow and learn every day -Very results-oriented; they trust the employees and the different ways of working -There is an everyday effort to make employees happy -You can grow as fast..., -Lots of work to do., 
﻿One of the easiest ways to make and save money if you're committed..., Total flexibility Competitive compensation total freedom to "log off/clock out"when you want networking opportunities unlike any other, Travel to distant and unusual places put mileage on your car routine car maintenance necessity of gas-conservative vehicle weight gain, Don't screw over the drivers or the customers and you'll be golden
﻿NOT WORTH IT, Easy be your own boss and work when you want., -Low pay: Pick up fee's are not 3 dollars as claimed (often much lower) and you do not get 1 dollar per mile. -Low public knowledge/use: Very few people use the app - you can drive around heavily populated areas for over an hour and get nothing. - No tip option: There is no in app tipping offered so you rarely get a tip. - Terrible in app GPS: The GPS that is used by UBER is abysmal completely inaccurate. - No..., Add tip option. Fix the GPS. Increase rates for drivers.
﻿Don't be a software engineer at this company, Lots of smart and young engineers to work with. But the working environment is competitive instead of collaborative. You need to be very aggressive and good at stepping on other's shoulder to move up., Terrible culture and management team. No work life balance. Extremely long working hours and hard to get vacation days to recharge. You have to work even when you are sick., Please care about employee's happiness and health.
﻿New Starter After The Susan Fowler Blog, Moving from a non tech company to a tech one has been the best decision I have made. Uber does not lie when they say they are fast paced and rapidly changing. If you come with a confidence that you can contribute in your own way and are comfortable in pursuing those ambitions without needing to be checked each step of the way then this is the company for you. If you feel you are not able to make a decisions without..., I work away from San Francisco and the internal challenges Uber faces are more SF based. The external challenges are more global. You need to really believe in the current and long term goals of the company you will question yourself and be questioned by others but you truely believe then you will become a great advocate for the change both internal and external we are making., 
﻿Freedom To Choose, Freedom to personally choose one's schedule., Save money for your car., 
﻿It has been a rollercoaster ride for me at Uber. The work culture and the people are of good help., Work culture Peer group Work-life balance can be possible only if you know how and when to work Perks, Rotational shifts will take a toll on your body and your daily regimen. This might hamper your productivity if you're working just because it is your organisation business requirement., 
﻿Amazing job with potential of impact a lot of lives, Collaborate to change the world Flexibility and self-driven work Not much bureaucracy, Very fast paced - not necessarily doing the best thing Stress Difficulties to in work/life balance, The management is trying to change some of the bad aspects of the culture but in the meantime the transition is going very well
﻿Working for Uber is an amazing job and Uber has amazing perks, Where do I begin? Working here is literally anyone's dream job who loves social networking! I have only been here for 3 months (celebrated my Uberversity today) and I love it. The location is a pro in itself. You get to see Phoenix from an amazing high rise view. If you work a morning shift or late shift watching the sunrise and the sunset of Camelback Mountain South Mountain and the city is just breathtaking. Besides..., Leadership. Some of the down side to working at Uber unfortunately is the people in a position that allows for bad team leads that are antagonist allowing inappropriate commentary to be made. The majority of contacts that we handle are global and diverse yet within the COE diversity it's intolerant. There is no other support besides an English language support so many times contacts are resolved due to "foreign language"..., Leadership should be there to actually provide support and guidance to CSR job responsibilities. Hiring leadership to just 'manage work time' is ludicrous. Putting someone in position that can't provide support to the staff they oversee consumes too much time and is wasteful. Reconsider leads that are a burden on teams. This position is capable of being a all the way around happy and satisfying job that's fast paced...
﻿Uber Driver, There are no pros for working with Uber. Most people who do so only because of their current financial situation, Wear and tear on car not worth it, Communication needs a complete overhaul currently almost non existent
﻿The great... startup, - Excellent conditions - Many interesting challenges - Great team, - Sometimes too many tasks you need to deal with at one time - Not all the processes are perfect (sometimes still like you're working in a garage startup), 
﻿Uber is a joke of a company, Nothing at all nothing nothing, Uber is a joke of a company and they don't care about the drivers or passengers, 
﻿WOW, You can make more delivering pizzas We average $15 to $20 per hour....that is before gas!!!, Let customers know that we don't know where we are going until we get to them. We may not be familiar with their area...and we may have to cancel due to time restraints., 
﻿Good Experience, , , 
﻿Ok so far, Flexible hours work as much or as little as u want low barrier to entry., Not making enough money. Don't get enough riders., Better gas savings card. 1.5 percent off gas is negligible considering I drive a Prius. Raise the base salary.
﻿Call center..., Great medical benefits free food free parking, Culture management lack of leadership., Seek out leadership development training and follow company values
﻿Driver, Flexibility and meeting new people., Work/fares can be slow when you want them to be busy., 
﻿Great rewarding experience!, Lot of opportunity for growth ton of autonomy amazing people challenging, Not for everyone - long hours but really rewarding work., 
﻿Short time with an explosive company but easy to burn out, , , 
﻿Driver, I love being the boss and making my own hours, Hate driving in bad weather, 
﻿Why Uber saved transportation, It gives you your own schedule to work around. You meet new people every trip while also giving you the chance to network. The money is also very good., Sometimes the customers can be messy or very rude. It is an expectation to have some bad riders. There are many that do not talk at all. This are the only Cons., I believe there need to be more transparency between management and the employees. There is no way to contact anyone from management. There are only representatives.
﻿The Greener Side of The Fence, -Having the best and smarter people beside you -Ownership - Perks - Paternal Leaving is awesome, The #Hustle value is not for everyone. It is a daily basis and if you don't get used to it growth will be almost null., Continuous improvement is a most. I'm glad how fast are becoming a legendary company.
﻿great company, , , 
﻿good, you get to work on your own schedule, have not found any yet, 
﻿Exclusively for hustlers, If you get the role you want here you will LOVE what you do. No role is too small at Uber and every single move you make will affect someone's life. You can see the difference you make from Day 1., You will be working A LOT. You won't be seeing your friends and family as much as they would want. BUT if you are a workaholic (and most people at Uber are) you won't mind it as much :D, 
﻿Customer Support Representative, - People in my team - Free snacks drinks? - Pretty much nothing else, - No career opportunities for smaller markets/teams - Worst management I've ever had no one cares about us. When i started here it was a lot better. - Everyone is talking about culture but there is no culture at all, Start doing something already make Uber office in Krakow great again even that i don't believe it will happen any time soon. You are all just smiling to us and it seems that you are just pretending that you actually do something here. No one ever asked me why i did over 80 tickets per day at beginning and now i do like 30. Well it's all because of poor management of this office.
﻿Uber sucks, Pay on demand work when I want to, Crappy app with constant issues; navigation problems; customer service is non-existent (it's not about correcting problems but rather how quickly they can close any inquiries); pay isn't stable: not getting tips stinks (half the time I have to park and go find the person when they're supposed to be waiting outside)... many other problems, Get a clue!
﻿New York City Uber Driver, Decent pay Work whenever you like Work however many hours you would like, Commission + State sales tax takes off a hefty portion of your pay., As someone who has been driving with Uberx for almost two and a half years at roughly 50 hours a week and has a solid 4.92 rating at this time one welcome addition would be to institute a tipping system through the app so that passengers may be free to tip if they wish to do so.
﻿Operations Consultant (Experts  PSR In uber language ), I have joined as Expert (operations consultant ) for uber for one year  supportive team Good facilities Managers are cool good opportunities to learn and grow Flexible timings, Its in the pay rolls of some 3rd parties  not well organized in terms of hr team  be prepared to see blunders in your pay slip with this pay slip you might face lots of trouble when you slide to other companies converting into full-time role becomes a real pain for this role, Better Hr team

﻿Dvo, , , 
﻿Uber provides great employment opportunities for the prepared candidate, you can work as little or as much as you desire. No set schedule take time off whenever you choose., you never know how much your going to make in a given period of work and it puts a lot of extra maintenance on your vehicle., Company is on a great path just iron out the bugs don't go too elaborate or you'll lose what makes uber great.
﻿Driver, meet new people every day, more work more stress but less income., consider the increasing the drive income.
﻿Driver, Work your own schedule. You can ask for a $5 miscellaneous credit for Excessive wait times at the restaurants. Flair/trip review, Waist of time. I sit for hours on line in front of the popular restaurants with out an order. It's 120 degrees in Phoenix so the AC uses gas to just sit and wait for orders. Once you get an order you have to wait from 10-45 minutes for the restaurant to prepare it. If you cancel like the app suggests you get penalized. Also People answering the door naked. All you can do is give them a thumbs down. I'd like to be able..., More promotions! Phoenix! Update for Tips Today!
﻿S.P.O.T Account Manager, -Great Experience -Great Company Culture -Work with Talented people, -low pay for the amount work you sometimes do, none
﻿uber expert I, Great company. Even Better benefits, Angry partners. Pay could be better considering the abuse we take everyday, 
﻿One of my most exciting professional experience so far !, If you have a strong independent fast past and creative mind you will love working at Uber. Trust towards employee's creativity and ideas make my job really enjoyable. I also get as much support and guidance from my management and team that independence in my daily tasks and projects. Also if you are a team person and not averse to risk nor to changement Uber is the right place to be. You will learn and grow faster..., Not easy to love a firm that is currently undergoing so many bad reviews... Gap between press and reality might be sometimes challenging., 
﻿PAY IS SOOOOOOO BAD, Be your own boss work whenever you want, the pay is soooooooo bad. You can make more working at McDonald's., 
﻿Driver assistance sucks, Choose hours kinda. Work as little or much as possible., No phone support!! Shorty rnail support. Useless twitter support, Make it easier to get help.
﻿Will put you out of a job for no reason at all with no remorse. DO NOT work here!!!, Flexible hours if you don't care how little you get paid for those hours., Their "support" for their drivers is only offered through the app. They are outsourced staff who literally cut and paste generic responses to your issues. Contacting competent staff who can actually make any type of informed decisions is not possible. The organization has no morality and flat out lies in PR to pretend to be something they are not. For example in a case they had in Broward County one of the upper-level..., You can only lie to the public for so long until ex-employees like me speak up. I have every intention on relaying this whole matter to the press and doing all I can to negatively impact this company. Your organization and its lack of morality truly disgusts me. I am doing all I can to push Lyft in my area now and discourage the local community from using Uber.
﻿Good flexible additional income, Flexible hours you can choose to work whenever you want although certain times will get you better money. Quick to get pay weekly or immediately put in account. Get to meet mostly nice people. Management has been quick to resolve some problems although answers are online and not always specific to details of the problem. This is remedied by lots of online info videos by other drivers to help learn info and tips. I..., You have to work the busy time periods to make better money and find what those times are in your area. In my area weekend nights or after events. Biggest problem for me is that you don't know the rider's destination when you accept a pickup and can't choose an area to stay in you can get sent far or to an area with no return trips wasting gas and time. I often get people going to areas of Miami or the airport..., Get rid of the carpool option riders don't understand and get angry at drivers plus it is more expense for us. Have customer service easily accessible over the phone especially for issues while on the road. Let drivers choose a work area to stay within before accepting rides at least half the riders I take going to Miami tell me they have been turned down by other drivers I won't do that once I accept but others...
﻿Uber Driver, Work when and where you want. Clients appreciate your work and your company. Meet interesting people. Get to know your city., Must drive at night to get best pay. Getting airport and city certifications complicated a job that had been easy to get into and learn. Day-time drivers make much less than night drivers. Wear and tear on car., Best thing about Uber was how easy it was for qualified people to get started. Company needs to make additional requirements simple and easy. Communications with drivers was pretty bad to non-existent.
﻿Great Job, Work own schedule Meet lots of really nice people, Less than minimum wage unless you work late night, Treat employees bettet8
﻿driver, very flexible schedule no boss, tiny fares and short rides, 
﻿Treated employees like they were always expendable, All the free food but after your first hundred subs you'll l never eat another godmother from Bay Cities again., Almost everything else I loved working with other distributors and providing this fun new service in LA but Uber cooperate was never the best at communication or providing benefits with it's workers unlike UberX distributors needed to be dependably on time at various partnered restaurants six days a week driving to and from distro sites and dispensing food to the Uber drivers for delivery.

﻿Absolutely UBER NOT PROFITABLE, My comment posted on Yahoo News Uber not profitable to Drive for... I just left Uber as a 4.77 rated driver with over 2000+ pickups in 7 months. My experience was absolutely F-minus in profitability extremely risky driving in parking lots and city traffic through numerous gridlocks etc. Other drivers may have had better experiences. Consider 30000 miles racked up on my fairly new Toyota in 4 months driving 12 hours..., Business model is stacked in the UBER Corporate direction. Drivers cannot afford the extremely low ambiguous HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE payouts ranging from $1.61 to my max of $56 or so for driving 10's of thousands of miles sometimes very dangerous driving situations ruining their car in 18 months or so. My take home was an impossible $11 per hour invested which was butchered down by 33% payouts to Uber off the top..., 
﻿UberEATS Driver, No schedule is really the only upside., Low Pay. Must use own car/gas. Potentially no offers. Tips not encouraged., Add tips or increase rate.
﻿Uber Eats Driver, The cons are that the app is constantly crashing and it does not give you all the information about each delivery all at once, Improve the app and give the drivers more information about their trips so they can make an informed decision about each delivery, 
﻿Great but inconsistent due to regional seasons, Comfortable flexible good money during fall and spring due to high demand of students., Wears down car quickly inconsistent pay and demand have to work difficult shifts in order to make best possible money., Make sure you manage your time correctly or you won't make a whole lot of money.
﻿Transportation Provider, Flexible; meet interesting influential and encouraging people, Must pay own taxes wear and tear on vehicle riders don't tip that often; not a lot of XL trips requested, 
﻿Driver, You can make your own schedule you can make as much as you want depends on how much you can work, They don't pay enought for mile or minute comparing to the damaged caused to our cars, You should increase the fares because we earn enought for us but every mile we drive our car is losing worth sometimes more than we make
﻿Terrible Rotten No Good Company, Can work you own schedule., Uber takes a huge chunk of the fare and leaves you with pennies per mile., Increase fares!
﻿Horrible Pay, Flexible Schedule and you are your own boss., Pay is very bad. Customers are rude., Rates are insulting. Uber drivers get paid garbage for long hours of work. Lyft pays better than Uber does. Keep lowering the rates and you will eventually lose all your drivers.
﻿UberEATS not worth it, The only pro is being able to work whenever you want., Very very low pay constantly putting in gas you're suppose to deliver door to door for no tip and that includes high rise condos. I barely made $100 in 8 hours also if you order McDonald's you can come downstairs to pick up your food. Not worth it. You can not make ends meet with this app., Pay more to drivers they are still paying for gas and any damages to their cars. It's less then minimum wage... shame on you
﻿Working as a Driving Partner, Time Flexible Entry Level Be your own Boss Career change essential, Uber Support - which used to be only through email. System Functions - Company methods/ethics, Listen to your employees.....
﻿driver, you are your own boss, it is not a job that you can rely onsalary is too little, decrease the uber fees
﻿One of the best!, Environment location perks and what I do is unique and very different from the previous jobs that I had., I don't believe there's any., Keep it up!
﻿Community Operations Specialist, Amenities food people. I was never wrong on wanting to work here., Location it may not be very hard for me to get to work but I hear my co-workers ranting about traffic since the office is in BGC., We may need to reconsider on how we gauge employees when it comes to their stats. There are lots of good agents who don't really get recognition. I know people that happily assist me when I am having a hard time and they are really good at what they do. But I don't think they are being recognized enough.
﻿Horrible, You set your own work schedule 👏, I stopped driving after three weeks. They take 1/3 of your income and don't pay your taxes.😨 Customers will get in stinking sometimes like bowel movement.😤 Customers don't tip most of the time. Low pay.😬 Try/Forces you to take animals in your car. I don't transport pets! 😡Mess your trip pay up and your lucky if they pay you it. They don't pay for damage to your car when a customer mess it up. 👊👎They keep lowering milage..., Pay employees/drivers taxes you are taking 1/3 of our pay pay our darn taxes.😡😬😡
﻿Uber Driver, it allows you to make your own schedule., not enought rides. hourly rate is less than $10.00., Uber is charging and paying too little. There should be a minimum charge for trips. A friend made a trip with 3 passanger and was paid $ 2.75.
﻿It's been an eye-opening yet ever so often mind broadening experience to say the least., Travel. Working on your own time . How much you make depends on you mainly. Meeting new people with a fresh take and views on lifelivelihood and lifestyles., Putting your life on the line as you drive to different locations daily with the possibility of being a victim of a gun crime . Technical issues with the app that might shorthand your keep., It's a techno-savvy environment and they could always try to have a more detailed description of how things work for the ones on the platforms not so familiar with technology .
﻿Great momentum, Despite popular opinion the people working at Uber in QLD Australia were generally great to work with. Fast paced intense environment where colleagues worked together to get things done - and things did get done., Internal communications could have been more inclusive and structured., Stay proactive keep in touch with the front lines in terms of partner/customer interaction to help drive decisions that your data suggests to you.
﻿Driver, Low pay considering the costs, Pay a little more to assist with wear and tear gas costs., 
﻿Uber Partner Driver, Easy to manage because of your own timings, Lot of Drunk Customer, 
﻿First three months @ Uber, Great team to work with. Diverse and Inclusive (not just on paper) Lives it's values. Lets you be yourself... rather encourages it. Extremely enabling culture, Overwhelming speed of work sometimes makes starting out at Uber very challenging, 
﻿Grate place to work with amazing people, Take decisions and choose your projects, It takes your full dedication, 
﻿Least professional Job possible, Free food Uber credits no dress code, No dress code college/high school environment non existent leadership way too much Kool aid. 'Talk' but no 'Walk', Train your team leads or team manager to actually behave as such not to be confused with micro managing. There's a lot between micro and nothing. I worked in their Incident response team for 6 weeks. After 4 weeks of training we entered team. practically non existent welcome or introduction or expectations nothing!!!!

﻿Green Light Hub Expert, The co-workers are fantastic but most importantly. Changes actually happen.

﻿Great place to work!, Amazing place to spread your wings and learn new skills., Constant reorganizations can lead to confusing structures., 
﻿Great experience; limited traditional career progression, Amazing work! Some of the most satisfying and challenging work in my 10 year professional career. Peers are the smartest most inspiring professionals that challenge you. I'm sure you've read the news and articles about how Uber is a terrible place. In my experience those articles for the most part take a minor thing out of context and sensationalize it. It's easy to pick on big bad Uber but the truth is the people here..., The external perception of Uber can be unfair. Also if you're looking for great salaries and titles and career trajectory look elsewhere. People work here for the work directly in front of them and the ability to impact the future with it. If you need a title to justify your self worth you won't get it here. Also if you're outside a main hub there's no growth opportunities., As we mature as a company and centralize don't forget to be loyal to many soon-to-be Uber alumni. They'll be people that set your reputation in the professional space.
﻿Flexible schedule at a cost, Flexible schedule Ability to set your own work/life balance, Terrible driver support Pay isn't as high as it seems when you consider gas time mileage vehicle wear and tear etc. Extremely stressful conditions, Treat your drivers better - your company is worthless without them!

﻿Driver Partner, Flexibility can uber whenever desired. Instant pay ability to pay yourself 5 times a day from your trips., Saturation of drivers. Depreciation of vehicle . No in-app tipping., Need to put a cap on drivers and need in-app tipping.
﻿Too much bureaucracy not enough substance, A lot of responsibility early on in your career, Too much political nonsense to deal with,

Think about your expenses., Better support for employees. Every time I emailed support I swear they sent me a response to a question I didn't even ask...in broken English. Terrible.
﻿Unfair Treatment to Uber Drivers, The app was easy to use., I worked with Uber for about a year I was the only one working. I am a father of 3 children. Uber is not fair to its driver being an Uber driver was my full time job until just recently they ended the partnership because I refused to give a person a ride because their dog was dirty.

﻿working as an uber eats driver, Flexible hours and work whenever you want, takes a long time of waiting to get a delivery, dont hire so many people
﻿Driver, Picking your own hours. Able to put money aside or invest in retirement options. Health insurance offers., Better rider information. Knowing where the destination is before accepting ride without cancellation penalties., 
﻿Enjoy, i like that I can practically be my own boss. i balance my personal life well, the only time to make good money is in the morning time during the week., management is good and they also respond very fast
﻿AM, Little room for growth Bad communication from upper management, Be more open when changes are on the horizon, 
﻿Amazing, Benefits are great lots of opportunities to grow and travel around the world. Management help and guide you throughout the way., No big downsides you control your own path in Uber can sometimes be hard to motivate yourself when no one is there to push you., Good job strong team nice financials great margins. Well done boys take a bow providing growth and opportunities.
﻿Panic driven development, Good company to be at. Smart people bright ideas great vision. Truly enjoyed working with the people from all layers (eng design PMs analysts etc), Nervous and "toestepping" environment: people spend too much time on showing off in front of the management instead of doing real work. Too much of the career focus: your teammates can step on your head if you fall down :), No advice here at all. Probably reduce the amount of load for people and adjust the cultural values that are hard to remember
﻿Still lots of disjointed teams due to lack of coordination at executive level, For someone who thrives under strong leadership vision Uber is still weak. Great leadership folks have been promised to get up and running. SVP of Strategy Francis Frei and SVP of Brand Bozoma Saint John. There is no CMO or COO seat and my thought is that Uber won't become a fully transitioned powerhouse until those seats are filled and even then it will take them 6-9 months to get alignment for work to really take flight., Disjointed coordination between brand marketing communications and product. No clear brand vision or direction other than an engineering led mandate to make the product available and ubiquitous as running water for everyone everywhere., Get a strong understanding of consumers what they value and care about. Make that what you build product and messaging from.
﻿Needs uniformity, You are your own boss., Watch money because they will short you when ever they can with no explanation, 
﻿part time experience, good to improve communication skill and day to day skills, low payment for every trips. hard to earn good money, 
﻿No. Just no., Work your own hours., They can't track where they are sending your funds and lose money blaming everyone else but accounting. They don't have a system in place to show where they send money., Stop the embezzlement. If proof is needed I can pull out screen shots with customer support that refuses to share anything with me. My earnings aren't being properly allocated and there is no proof that they ever were.
﻿Great place to be a product manager, Exciting projects great people opportunities to grow helping people move around the world better!, Many of the problems we're solving have never been solved before; it's software fusing and transforming the physical world in profound ways. You can't exactly "coast" as a PM here lol. It's not like we're tweaking a login flow everyday..., Keep working on making Uber the best place to work in the world.
﻿So sad, Something to do in your down time., Not enough orders coming in DRIVE 20 mins for 4 dollars sometimes less with NO TIPS. Not worth it., Allow in app tipping. Pay more per delivery. Gas don't run on water.
﻿Great company, Good commission and paying for those who like to earn extra income, Alot of rides so you have to pump alot of gas, 
﻿Beware the Acceptance Ratio, Meeting people is often fun and makes the day (or night) go faster. Get to know a lot about the city that you didn't know. Flexible hours. In Los Angeles you CAN make enough to possibly squeeze out a living as an Uber driver; but... (see Cons), ...you will likely need to drive 8-10 hours a day 6 days a week to do it. It can be awfully boring. Some people have steep driveways that WILL scrape the bottom of your Prius from time to time. Some riders will treat you like hired help i.e. rude. You have to look for cancellation fees every week that Uber may be incorrectly be passing on to you. Bonus money for sponsoring new drivers takes 3 to 4 days to show up in..., Be aware that some drivers might have an accidental low acceptance rate. Find out if they are aware of it -- chances are they are not and that this aspect of the app is failing them. Add a tip adding feature to the customer's app already.
﻿Easy Job - Low pay, working at any time you want, pay structure is not in favor of drivers. If I am able to make the weekly bonus incentives then I make apx $17 per hour. It costs me $20 per day in gas and I have an extremely fuel efficient car. Not a great full time job but it is ok if you just want a little supplement income. There is NO customer service to help when needed. Uber company culture is degrading., Too many problems with the app give drivers a larger percentage of the fare. Provide a customer service phone number for drivers.
﻿Why are riders always right, Easy payout app. Flexibility to work, They believe whatever complaint a rider submits and decrease your percentage without giving one a chance to prove if its factual. Never understand the boost payments Its like riders are all honest humans and drivers must submit and accept anything that's issued. Drivers aren't very important to company only riders! They are teaching people to be unappreciative and always entitled., Drivers are humans too!!!..and should be treated with the same compassion that is always given to riders!!!..
﻿Awful...stay away drive for Grub Hub, The only pro is they pay you the same day. Thr only reason I even use them any More is if I need quick cash. I went to Grub Hub and I'm making $20/hr. Sloppy much better, No tips Uber tells customers NOT to tip You'll make 6-8 bucks an hour if you're lucky Support is a joke Company doesn't care about paying you correctly They constantly screw you out of money they owe you It's the worst company I've ever worked form., Doesn't matter - there is no management. Company is a joke
﻿Data Scientist, Exciting problem domain and interesting problems. High impact to real-world people., No career growth. Politics everywhere. Tons of idiots leading very smart individual contributors., Get rid of these political kings in the middle management. Otherwise this great company will be doomed.
﻿Uber, flex time great people, you must pay for gas repairs late night can be scary lack of direct communication with management or company., set up corp offices in Cities all over area. have a better communication outlet with your drivers esp. in emergency situations.. have a 800 number for your drivers only.
﻿Driver - Contractor, Flexible contractor determined hours; decent communication with support when needed including quick resolutions; can make the effort worthwhile by taking advantage of bonus driver incentives., No benefits of being a legal company employee; funky uncertain liability insurance coverage; drivers take disproportionate risk compared to the company; not a good choice for a primary income source but to make earnings worthwhile must earn driving bonuses which can mean driving full time hours., Offer company employment for select drivers including benefits.
﻿Great as a filler but I wouldnt want to have to rely on it as sole income, Great flexibility. Work when you choose to. Meet lots of interesting people. Set destination feature is helpful if you want fares on the way to/ from another job etc, If you want to work day shift (in Sydney at least the money is rubbish esp after you take into account your taxes. To earn better money you need to work late nights early mornings / weekends- all the times you'd get paid shift penalties for in other jobs. Pay GST on full fare not on what you actually get paid. Not a guaranteed income. Some days you will earn more (or less) than others, put a cap on the number of drivers in one city. Don't manipulate the surge
﻿ripping you off, none that i know of, So i have taken a stab at UberEats on each level to get a complete picture of their profits. The first charge a fee to the costumer ordering for plus a mileage $.95 per mile. They then charge the restaurant 30% plus a mileage fee of $.95 and a monthly $90 to be eon their “platform”. They then let give the driver the delivery amount that was paid by the customer after they take out a fee. I did a delivery that i was supposed..., 
﻿Driver, Flexible time management lots of service, Below average pay sometimes below minumum wage lots of work and bad support from management., Garuntee us with quality
﻿it is a nice company with good benefit., Good benefit free lunch nice office space. No strict office rule as long as you deliver the work. Allow working from home., No company paid pension. Not much space for personal/career growth. Life/work balance is not great as there were a lot of meeting in later afternoon or evening time. Some bureaucracy in company culture., Reduce bureaucracy. Improve employee's life/work balance by reducing evening meetings etc. Create space for employees personal and career growth.
﻿Good pay, , , 
﻿If you must, Instant cash easy to try out, Not worth it full time or long term. It amounts to minimum wage when miles maintenance and tax are taken into account. They will not cover damage done to your car by a customer. Their insurance company RJ Davis has a 1000 dollar deductible for damage done by a passenger so anything less than that and you will get $0. The reason they can pay the drivers so little is because they have a high turn over rate and hire new..., 
﻿Full Time Uber, Flexibilty Gas Card Paid as a you go Flexibility occassional good surge or long ride tips Flexibility, Market over saturated with new drivers lower fares some rides unprofitable due to driving a longer distance to complete a very short trip. Lots of car maintenance., Communication is the key. Better responsiveness and availability to respond directly to drivers. Often responses to specific questions are returned with pasted paragraphs about a general topic without addressing the question.
﻿Driver's are last priority and are used and abused., My vehicle has a cracked windshield and a wheelchair scratched the plastic of my new trunk. I owe money for fuel each week and can't make ends meet so NOTHING POSITIVE., Expenses fuel costs commercial insurance is extra $100+/month vehicle depreciation market flooded with sub-par drivers once warrant check and fingerprinting were eliminated as hiring requirement Uber doesn't reward good ratings unfair rating system based solely on subjective opinion of passengers and nothing is objective or measurable (will get poor rating from drunk person racist person or someone that doesn't..., Value your good drivers (I have over a 4.9 rating with about 500 pickups). Make the ratings system objective and measurable. Act like your drivers are more than a piece of garbage that is easily discarded. Did I mention to value and reward your good drivers?
﻿Terrible experience, You make your schedule weekly pay by the pros don't put weight the cons unfortunately., The worst part about interviewing is not being acknowledged when you first walk in to the Sprint store (Uber partners). All the Uber representatives seem to be consumed doing nothing but surfing the web checking facebooks instagrams etc. To keep things short they lack organization skills tremendously. You notice this when you seem them pacing back in forth the store trying to sort out documents (kinda embarrassing)...., 
﻿nothing is what it seems, when I started in 2015 the incentives for drivers were really amazing and I believe during that time it was really worth it. The promotions were very fast and everybody was happy, The application or "app" is always in trouble many miscalculations always gives late and sometimes wrong results. The incentives now doesn't fit the driver's needs you are overworked and overpaid most of the time, be considerate to your employees that you call partners

I have never seen a single promotion and I have been online for over a month., Stop over saturating the market with drivers. Have a limit for each city. I have been with drivers who go above and beyond and others who are rude and have dirty cars. Lets keep the professional drivers around shall we? Like myself. I have a 4.95 star rating.

﻿Worst support possible, Super easy to send support messages about prevailing issues., They take 24-48 hours to respond sometimes and when they do 75% of the time they are useless. Support team loves to rehash everything you read prior to messaging them as if it solved the problem., Get better support employees. Not sure if these people are working from a home office but they seem to not be sound their job. Suffice to say I'll tell them if they are doing a terrible job in hopes to seeing improvements in service.
﻿Unethical Organization, Absolutely None the worst employer I have ever had., Deceiving promotions. Poor support from corporate., Treat your employees like human beings and they will respect the organization.
﻿Don't do it, None they screw you over, I got my car from bama leasing they did me dirty I was in a accident not in the car leased and could t drive for a while I told them and they worked out a deal the day edited I was supposed to pay the agreed amount they came took the car and asked for 3000 to get my car back then wouldn't tell me where the car was so I could retrieve my items out of my car me and my lawyer are getting ready to sue, 
﻿Best "Job" ever., I don't know how these people aren't receiving good pay. On a slow day I make double what minimum wage is and on normal days make triple that. The job is amazing!! 1. NO BOSS 2. YOUR SCHEDULE 3. YOU CAN BRING A FRIEND ALONG! 4. I'M MAKING OVER A GRAND A WEEK TO LISTEN TO MUSIC IN MY CAR AND NOT DEAL WITH ANY CRAP. This Job is amazing don't let the lazy people fool you if you treat this like a normal 40 hour week..., Do not contact technical support they know nothing.

﻿Amazing!, Night and Day from my last job! Uber cares about its employees and that is clear! Benefits are incredible! Uber credits are delightful! Uber cuts down on your cost of living by providing food multiple commuting options paid benefits and even reimburses gym memberships. They pay really well! (Especially considering my food and lifestyle budget has decreased significantly!) Wear whatever you want to work (Keep..., The companies site lead can be a bit condescending and patronizing. I've spoken or worked with her directly but in site wide meetings she always seems like someone you wouldn't want to cross paths with. Training was a bit too long. I wish instead of 3 weeks in a classroom there was 1 week in the classroom and 2 weeks of hands-on work., Keep being amazing and continue putting your employees first!
﻿Uber driver, work when you want possibility to make decent money if you know what you're doing and have fuel efficient vehicle., uber changes fares/policies/terms of service frequently in their favor and less in the driver and passenger's favor. questionable business practices with "upfront pricing". passenger charged more fare than what driver sees therefore uber's commission is more like 40-45% than the advertised 25%, 
﻿Its a great way to earn but more can be done for drivers than what is, Schedule very flexible. Making my own hours makes looking for more work very easy and also being able to plan and commit my time around other things. Weekly pay also makes for better budget planning, Being held to a rating system based on more personal feelings vs actual interaction does not always favor the drivers., Open up round tables for drivers to attened to voice what is going on out on the streets instead of funneling it through 3rd parties at green light locations
﻿Driver, Flexibility and Pay did not outweigh wear and tear on car., Pay woefully inadequate. Many weeks pay barely covered expenses. Wear and tear on car was extreme. No tip capability on Uber App., Pay drivers more
﻿Software engineer, Very good and challenging work. Hard work is appreciated. Company's business is growing and lot of opportunities for personal growth., There were some cultural problems noticed. Management is working hard on fixing it., You are doing very good job at fixing all cultural problems. It make will the company a great company.
﻿High Management Turnover...., Loved the technology and the product., There was extremely high management turnover. It made it extremely difficult to maintain loyalty and follow leadership on projects., Keep your teams updated with personnel changes in advance if at all possible.
﻿A Complete Waste, Benefits for employees are exceptional, -The staff; when they're not pounding Uber's asinine and excessive 14 company values into your head they are spending absurd amounts of time telling you about how negative press or public opinion is just wrong. - From the moment you begin you are expected to fully adhere to any and all rules and regulations. There is no space for learning curves. -You never know who your supervisor is until you complete four weeks..., I understand that there are many people who want to work here and are willing to adhere to your policies to do so but as someone who commutes from the suburbs I resent being let go for being late. I wasn't even given the opportunity to finish training which took place at 3pm - my desired shift start was 6am which I got but I didn't even get a chance to arrive to my work shift on time because I was let go before that....
﻿Great Company to work for!, great company atmosphere and great benifits, uber drivers are sometimes difficult to deal with, 
﻿I drive customers for point A to B., Driving for Uber gives you the ability to choose your own hours as well as the area in which you work., Customers may give you a negative rating for what seems no reason at all. The Uber app can sometimes give you the wrong customer location., Please fix the location issues within the city... Maybe give customers the ability to choose landmarks instead.
﻿People Partner, Transparency of communication Culture eliminating power distance Fast paced environment Dynamic, As any startup still no clear roles & responsibilities, 
﻿Operations Specialist, Working for Uber is attracting. It's such a fascinating fast-growing company with values., Some internal stuff needs to get improved but it can be healed by time., 
﻿Driver, Work your own hours paid instantly, Responsible for ware and tare on a car, Nothin
﻿INTERESTING JOB, Work your own hours make as much money as you want or need to meet interesting people find out about where you live like restaurants etc, No incentives for experienced partners with continuing platinum status not many worthwhile partner bonuses lots of talk from management about fantastic changes havent seen any generic email replies from people who do not know your name no recourse against people who report you with a problem about your driving performance delays in getting bad drivers off the system., Listen to the professionals who drive for a living and more transparency about pay rates and making money
﻿Management has favorites, Great co workers fun place to be at times. catered lunch everyday plus a great downtown location, Managers didn't help with improving skills on am individual basis. Didn't feel like their policies were customer friendly, Pay more attention to employees on an individual basis
﻿Not All Good But Great To Have In Case Of No Work, No Scheduling Obligations to adhere to so that is nice, Pay is low and is always being changed by them, Set a standard fare and stick with it. The bottom end X drivers are the lion's share and are messed with constantly. Stop running it like a restaurant ..... Drunks are not to be taken seriously ..... Ever. These are our personal cars and we like to keep them nice despite the drunks in our back seats trying to trash them and then us in an email or text. Listen to the drivers and you will stay for the long haul. If...
﻿65 cents for a mile no way to work for this company, Nothing I gotta make money not just for pleasure nothing and nothing for pros they gotta do better job so drivers can be happy hopefully they will do, They need to increase prices no one wants to drive for 65 cents per mile and uber cuts their fee and gas I only make 45 cents a mile, Think about drivers they have to take food to their family they have family to feed them they don't do this job for fun
﻿Cheater!, You can work any time you want, Uber cheats a lot of times. The payment calculation-especially when I had longer trip- is not correct the filter does not work well etc. If you don't check what you're paid you have a good chance that you lose money., Be honest. Pay by actual mileage not the distance you figured with your stupid map.
﻿That is a amazing company to work!, I love everything about being part of this team and i feel myself comfortable to make my decisions. I always thought that a good work can be done when the employees are happy on their workplace., I have nothing to say about what can be bad on this company., 
﻿Uber Partner, Decent pay easy job easy to use app., Bad customers in your car inconsistent deterioration of car., Pay better
﻿Uber Driver, Got to be tech savy. Great way to meet new people. Great way to explore the city especially the night life., Customers tear up the interior. Who pays for amenities not the customer. As a driver if your customer rating is low Uber will kick you out. It doesn't work the other way around for the rider., Kick out the low rating customers. The TNC lot is small. Tell customers we don't pick up kids at school. We don't have baby seats.
﻿A great place to work with a lot to look forward to.., - definitely the people; you're surrounded by smart talented driven co workers. - professional growth-- there's always interesting & challenging problems to work on - growth of the company at the rate we're expanding globally it's faster than any other company ever yet still a strong business model that is sustainable. - great benefits catered lunches everyday uber credits every month, - we're definitely experiencing a lot of growing pains. there's a lot of changes that needs to take place to get us to where we need to be from a culture/work environment perspective but what's kept me optimistic is that the leadership team is receptive to change and are in fact a huge advocate for it. It's been a tough road the last few months and still a lot of work ahead but we're definitely seeing changes and progress., 
﻿Independence at a price, Independence work whenever it's convenient no boss meet interesting people find rides toward a destination, pay is less than optimal outside of major hot spots only way to consistently make good money is working late/overnights on weekends gas and car wear days are unpredictable, Less promotions so you can pay your employees more motivate them to try harder to find rides compensate a minimum per time spent online or increase the minimum pay per time during ride (to compensate for heavy traffic during rush hour).
﻿I knew the job would pay fairly but had no idea it would also become my dream job, Very friendly coworkers and a trusting company culture with lots of opportunities to take advantage of. The stars have aligned: I like my manager and his style I like the team I'm on and I like the work that we're doing within the Uber Advanced Technology Group. My manager is very flexible and emphasizes the balance of life and work., Lots of freedom and a relaxed pace often means lots of time for an insecure recent college grad to think they're under-performing., Appoint a mentor to people with less than 5 years experience who helps nubers get up to speed with the workflow quickly. This in addition to their direct supervising manager who may or may not also be the mentor as mine is.
﻿UBER EATS, a little money if you have no other work, Drove to McDonalds several miles away  picked up order . The Customes lived right down the street my pay 2.68 WTH . Geeeez at least pay a minimum order fee like Door Dash . UBER eats has no tipping on customer app . I took myself off line and wont be going back on unless things improve, PAY A MINIMUM DELEVERY FEE AND MAKE FIX IT SO THE CUSTOME CAN LEAVE A TIP FOR GOD SAKE
﻿Driver, Flexibility Scheduling and nothing else., They do not reveal direction you are going to until you pick up the food. Promised boost and bonuses? Forget it. Tips? Not in my neighborhood. Million dollars mansion I have delivered to guarantees 0. Last $160 worth of food order I've delivered - $4.20 pay from uber. That it for me. Deactivating., 
﻿Don't waste your time, this is a good way to get distracted and get to know the city and meet people from a diverse background, you wear out your vehicle and end up paying out of pocket for them to get rich. not a good decision to drive for them., fix the percentages and stop stealing from your drivers!! also allow passengers to tip!
﻿Uber | The Land Of Snakes, You can look like a real #winner with a cool shirt from work., Everything except the conversations that come up every time the family gets together., 
﻿Unsure how to answer this, -Great team work -Amazing benefits -A job that encourages people to be themselves as well as celebrating diversity, I will let you know when I find out, 
﻿Brand ambassador, Very flexible schedule to work with, Very little pay for the job., 
﻿Driver, Being your own boss Good pay, Unpredictable Starting out can be difficult, 
﻿Career changing, Highest quality of employees I've come across in my career to date. Prepared me for a variety of roles in the startup field the autonomy that was given to me at Uber exposed me to so many ways to overcome challenges/problem solve. Miss the hustle and people all the time., - Long hours like most startups (it's much easier now than the early days) - Performance based culture - Less upside today than earlier if that's what you're looking for, Keep focused on the goal alumni all have faith you'll steer us through this!
﻿Toxic environment, It's a fast-paced environment with little oversight on your day-to-day work, Uber is about as toxic as it can get in terms of places to work. There's a macho fratty atmosphere and everyone is expected to do battle for everything. You compete against your own teammates and are forced to be an aggressive to survive and climb the ranks. Even doing things that are ethically wrong are encouraged so long as it's good for the business/growth., Clean up your act -- bad behavior has bad consequences
﻿Brilliant Minds. Tons of Bureaucracy., I arrived early enough (2014) to carve out a one-of-a-kind role for myself. Uber was young enough to still truly feel like a startup and for it to attract truly brilliant employees. I was and still am inspired by my peers and the approach and speed at which they solve problems., No surprises here: Travis. The leadership. Performance. Growth. It's all as bad as it seems if not worse. The longer you've been there the more legacy actually can hold you back. The glass ceiling actually feels especially low for women., Transparency. Stand up for what's right or get out of the way!
﻿Account Manager, Great culture. Strong start-up feel to the company and my co-workers were dynamic. Workplace was open-space meaning you're not stuck in a cubicle and can sometimes work remotely. Managers were great at communicating as there's a very open communication culture in which they will try to work with your issues., Work hours are insane. Some days went up to 12-16 hours and there were times were I had to work weekends. There is also a disconnect from old employees with large equity shares in the company and newer employees. They see newer employees as a potential threat and this can sometimes cause strenuous office politics., As you grow treat newer employees with more regard/respect.
﻿Flexible employer., Pick your own work hours. I love that I am my own manager. Good money if you can drive at night on the weekends and rush hours., Trip requests can be slow at times. Uber needs to refine their app for pick ups in apartment complexes and hotels. App needs a better option for a louder tone when getting a trip request., 
﻿Quick cash, Job provides access to easy fast cashindependent work simple process for beginners., Salary depends how busy and how far you will travel depending on a busy day in certain areas may be a concern., More FaceTime between drivers and management company events etc.
﻿Make it work for you, , , 
﻿Uber Scam, You work when you want., Very Low Pay!! Don't be fooled by the advertised pay rate. What they advertise is before UBER takes their cut. Uber takes $1.75 per trip plus 25% of the trip and you pay for your own gas. For example if a rider's trip comes to $8.75 Uber will take $3.50. Which leaves the driver with $5.25 and the driver must cover the cost of fuel., 
﻿Uber rechnologies, Work your own hours being your own boss, No benefits. Paid per job. No work no pay., 
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Best job I've had, Very agile fast paced company. I love how good ideas scale fast in here., Sometimes it feels to me that the company should have more age diversity. It seems to me that Teams should have some more senior people., 
﻿Working for uber is not sustainable, Pay is little and unsustainable long term. Gas Wear & Tear burdens hurt you in the long run easily. Depending on what time of the day you are earning way below minimum wage and without benefits. No in-app tip and most people don't consider the thought of tipping after driving., Add in-app tipping 10 minute commute to rider should have an added fee. No incentives in my area., 
﻿good supplementary income, its accesible easy to complete task, don't pay for gas costumers can be difficult, up the wages or pay for gas
﻿Great for extra money not so much long term, Being able to choose when and how much you would like to work is the biggest pro for Uber. The benefits aren't bad and having the fuel discount for fulltime drivers helps., It can be inconsistent and unpredictable at times. Occasionally there are issues with the app that can leave you unable to work for some time., 
﻿Great opportunities with significant workload, Interesting new technology kind intelligent co-workers strong potential financial upside yummy snacks reasonable work-life-balance., Rapid growth has resulted in some lag in organizational development. In other words lots of developers without much framework like PMs or tech writers to help guide and amplify everyone's contribution. It can be challenging to work someplace that receives significant negative press., Continue to pursue interesting business opportunities. Be more circumspect in responses to the public.
﻿Operations, - A very energetic team - start up environment with mnc resources, - a super fast pace that is not for everyone - long working hours - you always got challenged both internal and external, - evolving into a mnc both structure and culture need to be carefully handled
﻿Uber driver, In small towns uber is much more profitable than lyft., Uber's application is buggy and freezes on the regular. Uber's navigation system is a far cry from google and it often shows incorrect routes. Uber's employee help service is just a canned response service., application is substandard for a modern cell phone the team responsible for making this program should take it back to basics. the application 2 years ago was 100 percent better than the application today.
﻿Senior Systems Engineer, Very confusing on finding the right people who own things, More process documentation, 
﻿A decent independent contractor job., I love getting to make my own hours. During surge and boost hours you can make petty good money., Too many drivers in the Charleston area. They don't stop drivers from coming from out of state to drive in our market. No in app tipping., Clients and drivers alike would like for Uber to allow tipping in the app...
﻿I have been driving about 1.5 years., Love the flexibility. Meet really interesting people from all over the world., Add expenses and wear and tear on car and you are not making much $$. I HATE THE FACT THAT UBER IS SO HARD TO COMMUNICATE WITH. Driving for events at ATT Stadium is usually a waste of time. Everytime I try I usually get so angry I'm nearly in tears. I have lived in Arlington 30 years and know my way around but I can never get to my riders. The traffic management is an embarassing joke. Uber is partly to blame..., Develop a plan with the stadium and traffic control personnel; Communicate that plan to EVERYONE and STICK TO IT. I challenge anyone in management or in Arlington traffic control to TRY picking up riders there!
﻿Good side money, , , 
﻿Great, , , 
﻿just a stepping stone, You make your own schedule, I live in LA so some people just expect too much out of the lowest Uber tier services there is UberBlack and XL for those things., 
﻿UberX Driver, At the time the market was good. You could make 1 grand a week. Work anytime. Weekly pay., Market fluctuates often and it got so low I had to stop driving. A lot of harassment towards female drivers from riders. Little to no tips because of awful advertising. Contracter job so you have to deal with the tax situation. No too much respect towards your personal vehicle from most riders., 
﻿Uber driving, Pay is on time, You can't make any money doing this really. Uberpool is by far the worst invention from a drivers perspective because it simply doesn't pay and is why most drivers avoid it at all cost! Driving for Uber will make you fall fast behind paying bills and it's not worth it even for small cash because the work is worse than working for McDonald's!, Raise the rates so that drivers can make enough to pay bills. Get rid of Uberpool and Ubereats! Raise the minimum pay for drivers to $7 per ride. Hold riders accountable when they no show and stop the rating system because it is unfair and does not show the real truth about drivers
﻿Stay away, Great product market fit - strong growth, Run by a sociopath - culture is highly toxic and deprrssing. The recent suicide is a prime example of the type of company Uber is. It may win but management here does not care about creating a great place to work., Treat employees and yes drivers too like humans.

﻿Meh, You make your own schedule, Always the same thing. Everyday., Hire your drivers
﻿Driver, Make some money when you want to, -no driver support -if something goes wrong you're on your own -the damage your car takes isn't worth it, 
﻿Great company getting even better, Brilliant people challenging opportunities and the ability to be a part of a rapidly expanding global company., Uber moves quickly. Most of the time that means having exciting and challenging projects. However that also means projects occasionally breaking down. In those instances it would be more useful for team members to take a step back and figure out how to move forward together., Keep up the positive change. It's already reaping returns culturally and I hope it continues. The pendulum is truly headed in the right direction and will make Uber a leader when it comes to having a great culture.
﻿They suck, None really. Worst company ever, They dont give a fudge about their drivers. Worst company ever., 
﻿UnerEats, Uber offers the flexibility to work on your own terms and has a great application which 98% of the time works great., Does not allow tipping on the app and encourages customers to not tip. Does not pay when food takes a long time to prepare. Sometimes the route that is recommended and the fastest route are different in length. GPS to some restaurants is off and no compensation is offered for the difference in miles., Listen to your drives while being customer centric is key Driver partners make Uber their millions it might be wise to listen before another startup does.
﻿Policy Lead, Mobility opportunity Autonomy to make decisions and personal impact on the company's development Full training opportunities overseas Super talented colleagues, You need to have strong mental health to cope with constant heavy workload, 
﻿Overall great place to work ..., Treat employees well. Respect views & ideas to improve processes. Non over bearing management., Hours can be long, 
﻿Good people doing good work, Data driven lots of autonomy great work flexibility and big challenges. I have the chance to really impact the life of a lot of people, Little disorganization on internal process, 
﻿Sourcer, smartest people that you will work with, just the typical growing pains of a hypergrowth tech company, 
﻿A Young Passionate and Growing Company, There's so much fresh energy here. All working towards the goal of trying to provide the convenience and comfort that technology offers to the community where they are involved in., It is still pretty young and some processes still need work., Keep working at the pace you're going with the utmost consideration to your employees and your clients.

﻿Communications and Public Policy, Intelligent group of people who are eager to teach you what they know., Cutthroat work environment for promotions work-life balance and hiring., Fix the "no-life" workplace reputation and focus on employee retention and improvement
﻿Account Manager, Good perks for full-time employees and very talented people in the office., Poor middle-managers constant restructuring good ideas take a backseat to politics and clicks., Listen to employees and seek their advice on decisions which will impact their workflow. Data is important but people matter more.

﻿Customer Support Rep. Review, Great environment great atmosphere great people, Work very hard to be a contractor, 
﻿Scam company, The company is master for luring people and they are very good on that. I can say they will be the best con company ever existed., Look sings for scam: 1. No contact. They choice to contact when and how Mostly Ropo. Customer service does not read the complaint but the title. 2. If it is too good to be true it is. 2. Does not care the drivers - Who are main component of the company., Have a number for serous matters. I have been scammed the who money I worked for one week. So far 2 and half days no one contacted me back. Act like company - Value your driver your customers and all your employers. See your self the negative news everyday. Your front line of defense is your drivers people ask and communicate with they as they are Uber company. The first word comes from the customers is You Uber. I...
﻿Avoid UberEats, No accountability required for employees, Customers pay up front and then its whatever.., 
﻿Refreshing., A strong team concept where voices are heard. Not a single day goes by that I don't feel like I'm BUILDING something truly impacting people's lives., Not necessarily a personal experience but from what I've had peers encounter: a lot of young managers who are learning to be responsible for a large group., Continue to identity flaws and seek to improve yourself. Learn from your mistakes instead of just saying you will.
﻿driver, , , 
﻿Driver, You work your own schedule. You get paid the hours you put in., Uber takes too much and you end up making about minimum wage after tax gas insurance...., Give more to your driver.
﻿Good for what it's worth, Flexible and willing to help with car payment. I know of many unemployed people employed by Uber and making a decent living and working for themselves, Made less money after changes to the app the Uber pool can be a scam for the drivers. Limited time bonuses., Put drivers first
﻿Great Team FOR REAL, The team spirit at all levels, It's a lot of work but definitely rewarding!, Keep it up with the Uber spirit
﻿Navigation, Uber is a great job to earn extra cash and meet different people., The navigation system is off. It's inadequate. It tells me to turn left when I should be making a left. The timing is off. While driving it says that my time of arrival is in 5 minutes and then it says 6mins 2minsetc., How can this be fixed?
﻿Loving my new gig!, The culture is really great despite the current views in the media. Everyone was super welcoming and has made me feel like a integral part of the team from day 1., None for me so far., 
﻿intern, a great exposure to start up world, a bit slow in hiring, 
﻿Just flip burgers and make more after you calculate taxes and gas., Nothing really. Is making your own schedule important when you're making minimum wage? Any reasons to enjoy this are the same as a taxi driver except for half the pay., They will constantly lie to you about consistently lowering the pay. The amount of pay you get has done nothing but decrease since they started. They make you feel like it's ok money in the beginning with bonuses then once a year they drop the pay just a little more after you have made a routine of it., Pay fair wages. More compensation for people getting sick in your car. Stop turning driver cars into musical toys for drunk people.
﻿Bad job, It is flexible no schedule, Terribly run company deliveries go poorly, 
﻿Your whole experience depends on the team you land in..., Super-smart colleagues incredibly interesting projects wonderful drivers. The Susan Fowler post opened up a gaping wound in the company's inner workings that I'd say are being genuinely worked on with very deep introspection. The technology is staggering and I really feel we get a bad rap from the media (i.e. we are NOT evil)!, The systemic paternalism and bro-culture is absolutely real. If you're a woman be prepared to be chronically cut off mid-sentence 'forgotten' off meeting invites and second-guessed. Depending on the team you're in you'll be the only woman around. If you're unfortunate enough to enter a team that's been together for a long time you have to really work hard to be included but don't be too pushy - or else you'll get..., TK keep up the introspection -- so many of us believe in you but honestly change cannot come soon enough.
﻿Marketing Manager, Full of passionate and innovative spirit Empower every employee, lack of systematic management too much attention on data rather than value, 
﻿Pays the bills, Working for Uber for 4 months. Meet nice people. Not really an employee. Actually Uber is my client who feeds me the business. No office politics no time clock no boss no deadlines. The Uber people at the Greenlight hub are there when I have questions. I am a retired 65 yr old female who just needs the money to cover the cost of Medicare. Perfect part-time job. Really enjoy it. If I want to buy something..., Wish there was phone support instead of having to drive to the Uber greenight hub. When I subtracted the cost of the ride share insurance gas State (Georgia) and social security taxes and averaged out my earnings for a week it's below minimum wage for Florida but about minimum wage for Georgia where I live ($7.25 hr) I could earn a alot more driving at night but that 's ok am still earning enough money to cover my..., The rating system could be improved. A person should be allowed to face their accuser. At least give the passenger a multiple choice as to why they rated the driver lower than a 5. If I did something wrong I can't look at what to do to improve if I don't know which passenger complained and what they complained about. I might not have done anything wrong. I would like to be able to at least appeal a low rating by...
﻿Driving for Uber, You have total freedom to chose working hours. There is no no supervision and you assume some responsibilities. Good wages compared with competitors., You assume lots of risks because you use your own vehicle., 
﻿I like doing uber but uber mess up a lot, I like meeting new people i work in a city and i hear other people say they get bad customers..i haven't recieved one yet not saying it wont happen. And i like how you can drive anytime with no penalties., Down side is they don't explain the bonuses lije tyre sign on bonus very well or the guarantee very well you have to guess and figure it out they mess up on your payments and when you contact customer service by email when you respond back and forth its never the same person and no one knows what's going on and you have too repeat yourself.. other than those things i would have given them 5stars but they will..., If they can see previous messages from drivers contacting uber.. they need to read previous messages before they respond. I have all 5 stars with uber for like 30 people who actually rated me i have great customer service.
﻿3 month anniversary, A very positive atmosphere., I have not come across any cons in my time here., Keep up the good work.
﻿Fun Extra Money, Work on your own time start and stop when u want with no boss and you get to make people happy by taking them food!, PEOPLE RARELY TIP. I can go hours without tip. They always tip pizza person but not Uber. The app doesn't have tip feature which hurts your base pay., Put tip app and stop telling people tip isn't expected..Pizza Restaurants tell their customers..TIP ISNT INCLUDED IN DELIVERY FEE! ADD THAT and it would be perfect!
﻿Operations Consultant, It was great to work in that free environment where I was confident about the work which I did., The management was not clear about its words., No
﻿Brand Ambassador, Great management they work with you and if you have ideas they will listen to them and let you execute them., Disorganized in the beginning. Definitely need to get everything together., 
﻿Driver Partner, flexibility own boss unlimited income make new friends, customers eating and spilling beverages in the vehicle, customer service support phone number
﻿Driver, Times and hours are good because you can work when you want to, Very slow right now it's the summer and it's dead right now, 
﻿Big Vision I'm Staying Optimistic, - I feel there's been a shift in work life balance. Yes you work hard but there's a lot of freedom and flexibility that comes with it. - Unlimited PTO is a HUGE plus. Do your work go on a vacation and come back refreshed. People on my team really take advantage of this and it helps with morale. - There's great people here. Don't believe everything you see in the headlines that's mostly click bait., You'll get used to seeing the company name always in the news. We're disruptive. Other historic CEO's have been in the press or had reps as well (Bezos Jobs etc) Don't let that deter you., 
﻿Recruiter, Cool technology fast paced work environment, scattered always changing process. Frat boy culture no room to advance unless you are one of the chosen ones, get new C level leadership and make the culture more inclusive
﻿Worst company to work, They have none. This company is garbage., This company is a scamm and u will avg less than minimum wage after expenses with them., Treat drivers properly
﻿uber - good part time job but not so much for full time, be your own boss. set your own hours. meet lots of cool people., no set pay or guaranteed pay per hour. wear and tear on car. insurance tickets maintenance costs and taxes owed to irs., raise the rates to the driver and put a tip function in the app already!
﻿Exceptional, Relaxed atmosphere diverse culture exceptional benefits and perks. Good leadership and opportunities galore., Maybe a little too lax...see people goofing off sometimes; taking advantage., If you are implementing change be mindful that change needs like a well-watered plant; to be nurtured cared for and absorb the that change in (amount perception) over time; gradual if you will. Not everyone takes to change easy and like the plant; can easily be a shock factor. I've seen this happen too many times to good companies and Uber is by far one of the best that I hope will enjoy longevity and endure.
﻿driver, ability to select own hours to work, This is perhaps the least ethical company I have ever been a part of. Everything they do is for the purpose of reducing driver independence and earnings. They fail to disclose any material information pertaining to the job which includes the costs associated with driving for them. Your direct supervisor is a computer corporate service is a joke they attempt to cheat their drivers out of every penny., 
﻿It have been pretty good so far, I have really enjoyed my time at Uber so far. I get to work on very challenging problems with talented co-workers and projects which have high potential impact and visibility. I love the extremely fast moving pace of the company. I have worked at some of the top tech companies in the past but the pace at which Uber moves something else., I work in a good team so i don't have any notable cons. However all the negative media attention that Uber has been receiving in the past few months is sometimes disheartening., Deliver on the promises made regarding making changes to the culture and values of the company.
﻿Unexpected, Great benefits cool co-workers lots of perks at the office. Leads are really helpful and actually care alot about you and your well-being (unlike other companies I've worked at)., Things change constantly so if you don't make an effort to stay up-to-date on things or don't like change you will struggle here, Get opinions on policy change before enacting it. That might make transition periods run more smoothly
﻿driving for uber, meeet great people as well you can network with interesting people, driving your own car putting wear and tear, 
﻿Choose your team and org carefully, Amazing tech stack. Good challenges. Good product offering. Good tech infrastructure. Great energy and peers. Rapidly changing environment. Leadership is open to feedback and seems like they will act on it., Lack of alignment in some orgs. Lots of re orgs. Not all Managers are fare. Favorites and friends benefit. Managers are not technical don't know enough about candidates and perf is in their hands as they represent you in calibration. Culture is more like deliveries over employees well being. You are expected to stretch indirectly through peer pressure. Highly competitive environment., It's now time to focus on Sustainable revenue generation.
﻿Community Support, The Schedule the environment people., The Food is not good at graveyard., 
﻿Onboarding process., Amazing quality of life after working with Uber. Never have to really worry about food or finances., If I can find any i will be sure to let you know., Keep it up.
﻿Horrible company to have contracted with, Flexible hours below average pay Below average number of calls, no insurance unless you have $2000 to shell out for deductible otherwise you are screwed. no protection rude customers that doesn't tip excepting too much from drivers and not tips High commission Expensive to keep your car running Customers leaving trash in your car No cleaning fees unless Uber thinks there should be one, Reduce your commission from 30% to 10% because drivers have higher over-head
﻿amazing place - but work to do, This company is truly changing the world for the better - its a shame our CEO and some folks in the USA keep making it hard for the world to see that! I've never worked with such smart and lovely people who are doing incredible work. The opportunity to have impact do super cool things and shape your career is unmatched anywhere in the market right now., The CEO cant seem to grow up and the rest of us suffer in our reputation. It under unvested in HR and process and now has a culture issue in the USA which again we all suffer from. The media loves to hate us and reports things that just aren't true which can be exhausting sometimes., Hire more HR people and get a great COO.
﻿Good culture nice people tedious work, - Nice group of people - Very flexible - Lots of autonomy - Great workplace environment - Best manager who inspires and empowers his employees, - Sales is not for some people; so it can be boring repetitive and demotivating - 8 hours of constant cold-calling - Limited opportunities for progression, Provide a mix of small project-based work in addition to the selling. Also offer commission for your salespeople!!!
﻿An innovative organization, It is really innovating organization which has become the need of almost everyone., Keep it up and do not stop sharing your ideas for common persons which is a great service of humanity ., 
﻿Support Rep, Great coworkers. Benefits pay is decent and work life balance up to par., Growth in company Better communication., Need better growth options.
﻿Despite culture still a rewarding experience, - The people really are great: so many cultures and backgrounds and a lot of regional and global collaboration - Relatively flat structure and lots of growth opportunities - Culture can be hit or miss and you'll know within a few months if it's a miss, - Culture can be very tough to manage with most people having big personalities. The company is showing signs of improvement here though - Hours are tough and you feel like you have to be online 24/7 - Middle managers aren't very experienced, Train middle managers better and don't promote people just because they might leave if they aren't promoted. Your entry level employees are genuinely finding it hard to find good mentors and good training here because the lack of care made when promoting or hiring managers.
﻿Overall a good experience however the lack of structure creates a chaotic atmosphere at times., great culture ambiguous environment flexible. perks., pay lack of structure lack of security., 
﻿Remote Customer Service Representative, Having the ability to work from home and make my own schedule., Management was not attentive to needs of reps which made it difficult for reps to be attentive to the needs of the drivers and riders. I went months at a time without any communication with my manager., 
﻿Community Support Representative, Amazing Benefits Free Lunch Free Uber Rides truly amazing culture stable quickly to promote growing fast competitive pay for entry level positions very nice office gym reimbursement and lastly full of young people., Because they promote within so much and most of Uber employees are in their 20's their can sometimes be managers that are a tid bit inexperienced., You have the best office culture I've ever worked for don't ruin it with petty rules.
﻿Compensation, In big cities during rush hours payout is very well. For example in Boston on a Friday and Saturday there are periods where you can make 30-40 dollars an hour, Driving in smaller cities was less rewarding. You would definitely need another job. Uber alone probably would not be enough., I do not have an opinion on this matter. I do not think I should give advice to management nor should they listen to me.
﻿Needs more organization and mature management, Free breakfast and lunch fast-paced workplace exciting product, Very disorganized little structure/standardization immature management, 
﻿Good sometimes Bad sometimes, Flexible no boss endless hours available talk to cute girls good convo, Rides too cheap 20% is too much for uber to take another 20% goes to gas some rude customers bad illegitimate ratings could cost job riders expect too much out of a cheap and sometimes free service complain about everything mad I dont have wireless aux for iPhone 7...really?? And too many drivers not enough rides to go around. Most people just wanna go a few miles...then wait 15 minutes for another rider who wants..., Raise prices in Orlando by 20% to cover your fee. And better driver support. Like a PHONE NUMBER
﻿Beware Working for Uber, Make your own flexible work schedule., Deceptive: Deliberately miscalculates drivers earnings. Manipulative: Misleads drivers about the dollar amount of fares earned. Insincere and uncaring: Does not correct or inaccurately adjusts payment errors made by the company., Focus on improving the work relationships that the company has with its drivers.
﻿Meh, Awesome hours and flexibility. During football season there are so many people requesting rides you won't know what to do with yourself., The only way to communicate with support is through email and it can get very frustrating. Drunk college kids throwing up in your car and being generally obnoxious., 
﻿Not long term, They advertise that they take 25% but it calculates to be more. One bad rating drags your score down way more than one good score pulls it up, More transparency with fees, 
﻿Low pay  Communication nightmare, Self Employed  Quick pay  No restrictions ., Low pay out after their commission  Communication nightmare  No direct calls  text only ., Either increase Driver's pay or decrease your commission to 15% instead of 30% . Put live customer service (US Only)  Stop pool service .
﻿They will always cheat and deceive you when it comes to your earnings!, The only pro is flexibility, unreliable source of income due to the volume of drivers signing up everyday constant reviewing of trips due to company stealing from driver on every ride They trap you once you get in and then cut your earnings by reducing fares There support is useless and only used to frustrate you till you eventully stop complaining and get back on the road poor leadership, Get rid of Travis! He is a horrible leader
﻿Driver- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, Uber dictates to drivers - Uber deactivates driver when rider complains and with no proof Customer service is horrible You DESTROY your cars value for little pay, Become a driver and see how uber really works and see how much you really make, 
﻿Good hand-on experience disappointing career growth, Extreme worldly interaction competitive environment best talent pool best startup environment and helps an intern to grow as a professional multi team work independence informal work culture, over work-load bad work life balance sometimes job assigned can be very redundant/obsolete impractical targets nill growth prospects everything else is fine, be open to employees and interns about what you hold in store for them its bad for you to lead them in the dark about what future holds in store for them
﻿Good place to learn and grow, Insurance Free rides by Uber, All new and creative ideas are welcome, 
﻿My experience at Uber so far, • You have an excellent training • You have the right tools to work • You can be yourself • People at Uber are actually teamworkers, • Still developing in Brazil but I know it is just for now, I actually don't have one
﻿Diversity and respect to people, I feel respected as a person I'm constantly receiving coaching and estimulation to get better. I really love working here., The company is very far from home. I just would like to change my working time because it's being hard to do other things like gym and so., Just keep doing this amazing job!
﻿Uber über Alles, The values are REALLY followed the environment is focused on human people are free to be themselves., I haven't found any so far., Attention to the drivers. Some of them seem to feel very abandoned by the platform (be it whether due to Brazilian mentality or to a misconception of the Uber idea) and that might become a snowball.
﻿The Best Wins Are Never Easy, Uber's work environment is increasingly more competitive everyday and it's encouraged through Uber's core principles., The downside is the same as the up. Uber's culture brings out the worst in employees who aren't conditioned for competitiveness., My advice to management would be find a healthy balance between traditional and new leadership practices
﻿Best opportunity for growth and development, Amazing company which gives you many opportunities to grow develop yourself and learn, Work and life balance. Very hard working environment, 
﻿AZdriver, Flexible freedom and own boss, You put wear and tear on your own vehicle., Keep hiring process tight
﻿Great place to begin career, Great office and nice perks (free lunch tons of snacks) Great people, Sexism Reluctant to convert long time contractors to FTE, 
﻿This is a good temporary or part time opportunity When You Can't Find Another Job, Work when you want and write off all of your car expenses like car loan car wash oil changes tires repairs etc. You meet a lot of nice people and can have great conversations most of the time. Driving is relaxing for me so I enjoy that part of it., Uber takes too much for themselves and should give the driver a higher percentage of the fee. After gas and expenses the actual hourly net income is pretty low. Sometimes you sit for a long time waiting for a rider which drops your net income per hours spent driving. The Uber app does not provide accurate information: it states there are 40 drivers in the queue at the airport when there's only about 1/2 of that I've..., Be truthful honest fair and ethical and your company will go far. If you continue to do the same as you have been doing it will bite you in the butt someday. Be more than fair with your drivers and your company will explode with profit and beat out the competition... but I don't think you will do any of this.
﻿Feeling a bit deceived but grateful for work., I love being able to choose my own hours. Also as a musician in NYC it is very nice to have a rental car for personal use when I'm not working to haul gear around., Again I'm grateful to have a job but their sign on bonus is nearly impossible to accomplish (25 rides of your 65 which originate in Manhattan during given hours) since the windows of time are small so if you are taken to an airport Brooklyn or New Jersey you won't get back in time... I had this happen to me and despite fulfilling 65 rides I found this clause impossible to fulfill. The sign on bonus was really the only..., Allow drivers a tracking system for your incentives they are extremely confusing and difficult to track. I'm sure it saves the company a lot of money doing this though...
﻿Incident Response Team, The Culture here at Uber is amazing you can really be yourself along with you find friends who match your crazy., Clashing personalities would be the only con working here, 
﻿The first time when I was treated as an adult, This was the first company who had ever treated me as an adult giving the decisions on my hands and the freedom to provide an personalized answer to both Riders and Drivers., The work time journey could be at least one hour less than it is.,

Also as a musician in NYC it is very nice to have a rental car for personal use when I'm not working to haul gear around., Again I'm grateful to have a job but their sign on bonus is nearly impossible to accomplish (25 rides of your 65 which originate in Manhattan during given hours) since the windows of time are small so if you are taken to an airport Brooklyn or New Jersey you won't get back in time... I had this happen to me and despite fulfilling 65 rides I found this clause impossible to fulfill. The sign on bonus was really the only..., Allow drivers a tracking system for your incentives they are extremely confusing and difficult to track. I'm sure it saves the company a lot of money doing this though...
﻿Incident Response Team, The Culture here at Uber is amazing you can really be yourself along with you find friends who match your crazy., Clashing personalities would be the only con working here, 
﻿The first time when I was treated as an adult, This was the first company who had ever treated me as an adult giving the decisions on my hands and the freedom to provide an personalized answer to both Riders and Drivers., The work time journey could be at least one hour less than it is., 
﻿Driver, Meet a lot of new people and love to work any time of the day., No benefits and a lot of driving, Advancement positions to employees with high rating and more stars.
﻿Driver, Riders sometimes can suck sometimes you wait long in between rides car Maintaince has cost, N/a, 
﻿deceiving practice, convenient to work whenever you want., UberX really doesn't offer great pay. They rate is very very low. Basically you are destroying your vehicle(high mileage cost of repair) for they benefit. The reason i decided to write the review is that uber overcharges the customer upfront more than what the actual trip is going to cost. At the end of the trip uber deducts all the fees and never refund the customer the extra money that remain. A lot of customer..., Your ripping off both drivers and riders and you know it. Everything is programmed in the apps with someone knowledge.
﻿Uber driver, Flexibility early mornings is great time from 6:30 am to 1100 am. Weekends anytime especially uptown area and South Park area., Uber app need to provide the drop off location prior to the pickup location. Will greatly appreciate it. Need more tips., Update app for drop off location before pickup
﻿CS Rep, Nice working environment. People are friendly., Management needs more experience on leading a team., Maybe would put more attention on communications. As it is the key to success.
﻿Worked in operations, Great young team from all over the world internal tools and systems are world class office perks great (food outings and events), Hours were taxing favoritism no clear path to career progression below market pay, 
﻿Sales, Fun teammates Good benefits, Continual change in product and pay, 
﻿Uber driver, , , 
﻿Great company to work for!, Great benefits competitive pay awesome atmosphere and love the management, Constant policy changes (might not be a bad thing for some people), 
﻿Great place to work!, , , 
﻿not good, own hours and own ceo, not a lot of money, more money
﻿Uber eats Driver do not do it., nothing pro about driving for UBEr eats. Sad should be last resort or desperate if you will., First and foremost driving for uber eats suck. No respect for what they call their partner. Rate for driving for uber eat are always changing not for more but more for less. IN ADDITION Customer are encouraged not to tip so if you drive for UBER you will not be paid any tipping. YOu will only get a delivery service fee after uber gets 35% per merchant and charges their value customer 4.99 fee. YOu will get about 3.00..., GO and drive out there for a while and then start making decision that affect you so called delivery partners. IN addition add a tipping option. DElivery fees is not a TIP> finally rating systems sucks
﻿So far... Its awesome to drive for Uber, You get your earnings on the spot. I love driving and meeting new people., I wish I could call Uber because I'm new and I have some questions I need help with !, 'Same as the cons' I don't understand what "surge" means... I also would like to know if I can see where the riders destination is before confirming to drive them. I try to start in my general area.
﻿Customer Service Representative, Everyone is very friendly. Its more like a second home than a job., Schedules. But of course that's almost with every job., Keep doing a great job.
﻿GOOD COMPANY - A struggling culture, There are good health benefits a good sick leave and paid time off package. They provide food (snacks and lunch) throughout the day and encourage employee involvement and the best thing is that your ideas are valued. We have a small area with books you can always donate books (and read) and there is always something going on. If you have charity or community involvement goals the team will assist you with your idea...., Cultural collision - it's inevitable people may have been treated so unfairly at their other place of employment that the negative energy may be brought on. If you are not optimistic Uber is not for you. There is a lot of toe stepping and the concept is often miscued. Pick your battles wisely not everything is worth fighting for. I'm learning everyday., I hope the senior managers are being properly informed and not only rely on direct information from those in lower ranks but was investigating issues. Issues take too long to be addressed. It's best to address issues as soon as they arise.
﻿Good company, Flexible schedule and good pay, Need a phone number to call in case you have questions about policies or have trouble with the app, more access for employees who might have good suggestions for making your business grow
﻿Driver, Flexible easy-to-use local incentives instant pay, Low pay shady at times, none
﻿Driver, Flexible hours support will email you back quickly if you have a problem meeting cool people., Some of the people are jerks puts alot of miles on your car your car gets dirty from people constantly in and out., Up the pay!
﻿Driver, You get paid immediately but only for the cost of driving you don't make profit. You can drive whenever you want. Good for a month long gig to make their joining commission but RUN AWAY after that unless you're desperate to trade your cars value for cash cause that's all you're paid. See below for math., You make $0 profit no matter how much you work because math. In the Raleigh NC area the rates as of 5/26 are 53 cents per mile and 10 cents per minute. The value of wear and tear on a car and gas combined is nationally valued at 50 cents per mile which means you're making 3 cents per mile and 10 cents per minute profit. They don't pay you for mileage TO the rider so you burn that away if the person is over 2.5 miles..., Everywhere needs to be over a dollar a mile and 20 cents a minute. Paying us the value of driving and nothing more makes NO SENSE.
﻿Uber Driver, Breaks anytime Weekly pay Independence, The unfair ratings that drivers need to uphold., Change the rating system for drivers it is unfair that drivers that fall below a 4.8-4.7rating get dropped.
﻿Recently Hired Operations & Logistics Manager, The amount of data here is truly amazing. If you are a data geek or someone that enjoys analytics this is a great company to work for. People/Culture fit is a huge part of the interview process. They are looking for open-minded individuals that can help bring creative ideas to teams while also being a team player., Compensation is heavily tied to the growth (stock) in the company less salary than other firms seeking competitive talent., A-Team Management: Do a better job at managing the story. Sometimes our company is reactive instead of proactive. Love that a COO is being considered to help Travis manage the day to day.
﻿good, Competitive advantage in term of pricing, More than 8 hours per day, 
﻿Good, very nice company overall. Recommend, Nothing bad to work at Uber, 
﻿Uber: Maybe not, Sounds good on resume. Downtown SF if you are local. I really don't have 20 positive words to list so this is just verbiage to comply with, Infra poor for big data (overloaded data center hardware vmware overloaded do not monitor the network infra overload the physical machines even when the infra team swears to stop ML availability SLA/OLA compliance Some managers good (my original hiring manager) others suck (my second manager hates contractors does not like women who speak out of turn) Basically Uber is a low cost operation., I found the management teams so overloaded that they had no space to observe dynamics.
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule and easy work., Not Many. Had another job worked on my way home, 
﻿Time = Money, You get paid to drive people around (in your own car)! Based in Las Vegas I have been driving full time for 4 months and have kept extremely detailed records of my driving. My hourly average is roughly 24.50 an hour. I did a lot of research by talking to drivers to figure out best practices and optimal driving times. Who doesn't love a little side income or being your own boss?, Lots of hours sitting in the front seat. You never know what amount you will make., 
﻿Uber Driver, , , 
﻿Solid Work Environment With Good Benefits, Smart motivated co workers. Competitive pay and benefits, Occasional to frequent PR disasters, 
﻿Driver, Quick way to make money, Wages are low for the work, 
﻿Trendy Needs new management., They have great health benefits and the pay scale just changed and is reasonable but not livable for anyone with responsibilities. Dress is causal and they cater lunch daily. There is a stocked kitchen that is impressive and free for employees. We also get Uber credits monthly which are used to pay for UberEats orders. The location is central with great views of downtown. Leadership is lax and not much is taken..., Point system is strict and takes a year to fall off. Although you can move departments there really isn't an option to move up. They drill it in that you can move up and its easy to move up; That's not true. No room at desks. We sit at long tables with no dividers or space. It can sometimes be loud and hard to make important calls. Its trendy and a lot like high school. Rumors jocks and cheerleaders. A lot of..., Take charge! It isn't okay that people are walking around without shoes being loud and not working. Put your foot down manage teams and provide structure. This could be a GREAT place to work if management actually managed staff. It shouldn't be normal to talk about smoking weed and drinking at work. Clothing should be required and it should be an issue when people have open sexual relationships with others at work....
﻿Uber Driver, Get paid quickly. You get to choose your own hours., No medical benefits or paid vacation., Reward full time employees with vacation time and chances to move up in the company.
﻿Solve hard problems with great people, Uber is changing cities for the better and it's awesome to be a part of that., Uber's growing fast and it's grown big faster than just about anywhere else before which means you need to be resilient. I'm optimistic about the chance to be part of a great and growing culture though., 
﻿Needs improvement, They are adjusting the pay free food perks great health benefits. They are generous with time off and they offer parent time as well which is nice., Poor Leadership with no experience which makes for poor quality of work being produced. Its young and trendy which results in immaturity and drama. No space between desks which so speaking on the phone awful. They preach upward mobility within however its more lateral. Education isn't valued here, New Management! I think the company could really use structure among the employees and rules that are actually enforced. It will improve the quality and quantity of work produced.
﻿Glad I left, Pretty good place to learn about a multitude of open source projects. I loved my boss and met some really interesting people whom I hope to stay friends with in the years to come., Their 14 cultural values says it all when it comes to Uber and in summary; move fast ignore tech debt complain when someone tries to give you guardrails ignore the needs of other teams if it doesn't align with your plans. TK is a con man and I could never believe a word I heard him say. Many people do believe what he says and I found that dangerous because they aren't critically assessing his words to "get to the..., Time to pay back that tech debt or call bankruptcy and redesign huge swaths of the infrastructure. There needs to be weird from on high that this type of work will get someone recognized and possibly promoted.
﻿Driver, Flexibility of working hours I cannot think of anything good about this company other than this They provide transportation for drunk ppl, Uber did not pay salaries on time last week They kept the salaries for an extra 36 hours so they can make more money through interest Uber is one of the worst companies to work for in the world They treat their drivers like they are nothing They have zero respect or care for drivers They don't care about safety of customers or drivers They steal drivers through uber pool They think customers cannot and are unable..., Act like human beings Treat drivers like human beings Dictating everything to drivers and enforcing everything on them like they have no choice but to listen to your commands reflect very bad on who you are and the way ppl look at you You are nothing without the drivers but you still treating them ill Drivers will resort to unions to get their rights and no one to blame but yourselves
﻿Driver Partner, , , 
﻿Uber Review, able to make my own work schedule. Pay is pretty good. It can be a very social job depending on the client., Wear and tear on my vehicle and sometimes clients can be a little rude sometimes., Uber is a heart side job and not the greatest for full time employment
﻿Terrible. I choose lyft instead, Decent amount of ride requests, Nasty people who ride with uber. I have had at least 10 problems in 2 months. They pay hardly nothing too. Lyft pays more plus tips. Any time I reach out to uber customer service they are of no help whatsoever and a different representative replies each time asking you to repeat yourself. A bunch of morons work for this company including the CEO. To top it off.. the GPS is the absolute worst.. it takes me through parking..., Get this app together and treat your employees better! Upgrade GPS add a tip feature or naturally pay your employees more! Lyft is seriously killing this app
﻿Bad Customer Service, Its better for the CEO and the employees in the Customer service have to be impeached with Trump.They all are in one ship with Racism and Morality, Please be polite to your drivers.You have to think how Uber became popular its  because of your drivers., 
﻿Low Salary, 1.Great Place to learn 2.Helpful seniors, Office politics is too much non cooperative collegues  very selfish sometimes Working hours is pathetic low wages, Give holidays on saturdays.
﻿Promotions they run are a joke., No pros Lyft gave me a $1000 dollar bonus that was an actual bonus above what I made. Uber plays on words so that you believe you're making an additional $600.00 when you're really not., They pay less than Lyft the customer service is a joke. Also watch out for the wording in the promotions they are running. The $600.00 bonus is just a guarantee that if you don't make $600 they will cover the rest. NOT give you an additional $600. Lyft is better., Treat your drivers better.
﻿part time uber driver, You can set your own schedule unlimited earning potential., expensive when it comes to car maintenance., 
﻿Uber, Flexible terms and hours I can work on my own hours, Really bad pay. I paid for my car and it depreciates, 
﻿Uber Eats Driver, - Easy to understand the app - Great customers and business partners - Good pay and promotion rates, - Difficult to start work: I applied and it took them 2 months to tell me I was not eligible for driving they then took another month to tell me I could ride my bike. I was not impressed with this and therefore they have received a lower rating., Make the application process smoother by being more accessible to workers from multiple regions (e.g. having secondary smaller offices in certain places rather than a 'hub' in a hard to reach place)
﻿Uber Expert, Flexible schedule great supervisor (at my location) young atmosphere knowledge of technology, Pay accrued vacation training is not sufficient and lack of communication most managers & people in positions don't speak unless spoken to, 
﻿It is a good place to work in development and with a pleasant philosophy., Resolve customer concerns in the best way. Personal help. Medical and transportation benefits., The importance of staff at certain times is low and the knowledge of managers on business and personnel management can be improved., To work in the administration of the personnel giving tools of both knowledge and social to develop in an environment of equality. Use creative stimuli for staff. Provide days off for personal development.

I love this job and i want to make carrer here., You can look a little big for the Teamd Leads because sometimes they have some bad actituted.
﻿Uber&Humannity., Best Ambient to work with., working time its long enough i think should be a way to keep personal stuff in the building like tooth brush toothpaste personal care stuff like a locker., Thank for ear.
﻿CSR, Great place to work with an enviroment to help the needy on the platform. Nice structure of resources and kindy people in all of the LOBs., The payment had a delay for some weeks last 2 weeks was ok. Sometimes is not possible to be trained in time for the needed department ., Continue to help us as every day with the open doos policy. The metrics were not recognized in all departments.
﻿Top tech company for those looking to challenge themselves, - Challenging and rewarding work solving problems that haven't been solved before - Work alongside some of the smartest people in the world - Encouraged to take big bold bets - You get to see your idea all the way through and feel like you're having an impact on the business / world, - A misinformed public perception / lack of positive PR can be taxing on employee morale - Big hours as a result of running lean teams - Extremely fast paced, 
﻿Uber driver, Anytime schedule no stress and cool people to meet, pay is very low not work breaking the bank or car. I would suggest staying with your day job. Office people are jerks., 
﻿Positive experience despite negative press, - Uber has hired some of the best people in the industry. I've never worked with more intelligent and driven people. - Compensation perks and benefits were very competitive with companies of similar size. - The technology stack has matured considerably after some initial growing pains. Engineers can provision infrastructure and build/deploy services without excessive red tape. - Surprisingly strong positive cultural..., - Uber has a bad reputation and is constantly the subject of controversy protests and negative press. While Uber is not perfect I do believe the company has matured since its early years and leadership does take these matters seriously from what I've seen. If you can't handle seeing a negative headline about your employer Uber may not be for you but for those that can handle it and want to make a positive impact..., 
﻿Pay sucks, Everything People dont tip U drive 30 mins make 4.00 wtf!!!, Lower ur cut Add tip And ur buisness will be great, 
﻿Good company but they have some growing pains, Free food great benefits work with cool people that care about the company and the drivers, Communication last minute updates hours before product launches lack on timely response from other lines of business, Keep working on communication and keeping everyone in the loop
﻿Driver, Work on your own schedule. Leasing a car from their company Xchange Leasing allows you to have a car for your own personal use., Driving is dangerous. The lease cost is so high ($172 per week) that $17.71 gross hourly income drops to $6.29 net hourly income after gas maintenance insurance and tolls are factored in. [Data based on my records and receipts for driving period Jul 18 - Dec 26 2016. 508.17 hours driven 23 hours per week average.], Find a way to lower the lease rates; $688 a month is a terrible rate and shame on you for exploiting the unemployed.

﻿Sales Rep, Fun exciting work environment to be part of, Commission bonus was a bit unfair as you didnt receive any commission till after your 5th sale each week!, 
﻿The place to learn and unlearn, Hustle is what drives UBER., Nothing such only that you need to have a sense of driver empathy., Nothing. Great work
﻿Awful place don't be tempted, They'll waste your time gas and moral. They'll not tell you when you can expect to get off. A few customers will be awful. They'll always pay you for the pool even when mostly you have one driver. Wages are about $5 per hour., Tickets weird customers terrible management the app. doesn't always work., Terrible pay terrible app don't pay me $2.80 for the uber pool with one rider. You are all thiefs! Mind playing cheap thiefs!
﻿Boost Premiums Not Being Honored?, , , 
﻿Avoid Fraudulent Rental & Leasing, Simply signed up for car rental. Next thing you know I get a ping from Kredit Karma. Your credit report has new inquiries. Contacted them and they hit me with some technical mumbo jumbo. AKA "Didn't you read the very fine print?" Obvious used car salesman tricks. Don't do it!, Stop shady leasing practices., 
﻿Driver, I like the job and hours, Pay doesnt even cover my expenses and to tell people in your facts page no tip reqd is wrong. You wont keep drivers and when you treat employees this way you wont prosper in the end. God is watching and he has justs balances. So long I will tell everyone i know not to drive for Uber. This is sad because i fought making phone calls to help Uber into our Texas cities all Spring and Summer., Pay a fair wage add a credit card tip area for drivers.
﻿Passion innovation vision and future., Really passionate employees who have strong believe in the Uber causes. Fast forwarding futuristic vision held high by executives. Even with really bad media presses in the recent one month or two the company is still very resilient to the distractions. After a thorough cultural change Uber is going to be a proud place for the talents to realize their dreams. Everyone can be yourself without worries about politics., Long working hours because of lots you can truly own and resolve. Perks are not as good as big companies., Keep the good works and hire more great talents. Improve internal culture and improve public relations.

﻿Good Money for the right vehicle, serious wear and tear on your vehicle UBER-X Platform not worth the wear on your car so make sure your vehicle qualifies for the upgraded platforms, Break off a little more for drivers and keep less for yourselves, 
﻿Uber breaks a lot of laws, None. I don't have another job, Uber lies to it's drivers and the pay is less than $ 10 per hour. Uber illegally withholds your money., Do the right thing
﻿Uber Expert, Good environment and good manage Chris., Continuous temp status. Uses temp agency, Partner Support.
﻿High cost of living not enough pay, You make your own schedule You can cash out anytime you want. They accommodate handicapped persons. You can receive promotions if you refer people., The amount you make doesn't compensate you for the cost of driving nor a steady income. I have driven many 8 hour days only profiting 60 bucks. I am a disabled veteran and I was hoping I could rely on them for a substantial income but it is definitely not the case. They advertise you can make $20 an hour but in reality that happens rarely. So I am stuck making lower than minimum wage when I divide my hours by my service..., Needs to take better care of its employees pay wise and also needs to have better regulation on the airport in Tampa Florida there is a group of Uber drivers who sift through the people when they get down to the end of the que they call the persons once they except and then they cancel if the ride is not long enough for them.
﻿Overall Great learning experience, Company is growing with leaps and bounds.You'll meet and discuss ideas with some of the finest minds.It's a great company.I would suggest you to experience if you are a fresher., Since it was a contractual role.You'll have limited authority and responsibilities of making decisions.But the management is helpful in that but takes a lot of time in response since they are overloaded with work and don't hire more people in the team., Focus on people who are doing the real ground work rather than just focusing on business.Involve contractual employees in the perf session.
﻿driver, none to be honest. Can't think of any., This is a review of driving for uber after driving 100 rides. All the promotions that they say is yours after a number of given rides is all bs. What the headquarters and people that work in offices for uber don't know is that without us drivers they wouldn't have a job at all. Those office workers would be struggling like I did as I drove for uber. Plus the earnings you make your uber for example: I made 500 bucks..., 
﻿Amazing company staff could be better., Benefits physical structure environment culture onboarding., Human resources mobility employee support work schedule., Improve HR support simple requests takes too long to be solved internal transfer procedures were well designed but people have issues to apply them.
﻿It sucks for drivers, Flexibility to work .meet good people sometimes., Low payrating system discouraging to drivebios passengers  drunk rude etc., Take the burden out from your rating system for drivers.
﻿Driver, Good money flexible schedule and it's nice meeting new people of all walks of life. It's a very unique but fun job, Can't choose rider don't know location of the drop off until rider is in the car. Money can be bad if not surging, 
﻿Excellent team., The flexibly of schedule is perfect for my current student status., On-going changes but it's an advantage at the same time! Always learning something new., 
﻿Former Driver, Killing your health time and car condition, Take care your drivers with more fare, 
﻿You spend more money than you are making., Work your own hours daily, PAY is an embarrassment unbelievable!!, Start paying your drivers more money or your company will end up losing a lot of drivers because it isn't worth starting up the car to pick up anyone.
﻿On-Boarding Expert, Uber is a great company to work for. Friendly Co-workers and everyone is always will to help out each other to make sure everyone has the help they need to do their job., To be honesty their is no cons for me personally about working for uber. I love everything about this company, Keep doing what your doing. You guys Rock!
﻿Software Engineer II, Interesting Problems Great Team/People to work with, Toxic Culture is killing the Eng org No clear direction, 
﻿Driver; passenger and delivery, Set one's own work schedule. Able to do delivery or passenger or both. It is a good second job to provide extra income when needed., If without a four-door vehicle a lease through Uber is very pricey and has to be paid off weekly; with a lease it is difficult to net more than eight dollars an hour driving in the Los Angeles area The fare percentage paid to drivers is abysmally low. Some fares only pay a dollar or two on multi- fare pickups., Pay the drivers. Add back the 25% you've taken so that driver's can make $10/hr for their work and representation of the brand.
﻿Still one of the greatest companies, Still one of the most innovative companies in the world. People are great to work with and the work is challenging and interesting., Don't expect this to be easy but do expect this to be great., 
﻿valuable experience, work with very pro people, lot of pressure and cannot have private life, take more care on intern development
﻿HR/Talent Acquisition should walk the walk, High growth company lots to do/contribute town hall meetings show a lot of transparency. Smart people great problems to solve., Managers lead by fear. Not a collaborative partnership. Strict production environment not open to new ideas. Super young team very little bench., Look at your own team see if they are truly happy. Does the leadership team inspire and give opportunities or do they punish and keep roles small?
﻿Workers unappreciated, Work anytime and cool people., No matter how good your service is or how good you drive the service isn't reciprocated in the pay. Uber also gives different pick-ups as Im close to the person Im already scheduled to pick-up under the guise of it being a closer pick-up. When in actuality I just drove to a persons house only to have to drive to another address without pay. Company starting to really suck., Share the wealth reward good drivers and fix how pick-ups are dispatched.
﻿Interesting Place, Uber takes care of its employees well. There are plenty of nice amenities they provide. You get a lot of discounts from places., The opportunities to move up are very few. They indicate that there is plenty of oppotunities to grow and move up in the company but it hasn't happened for the 6 months I've been there. The work schedule is never set. It can change in a month in a few weeks or in a few months. The company doesn't really provide any feedback as to how we are doing. You would think we would get a 6 month review and possible increase in..., There needs to be better structure has to how to move up in the company. The communication isn't there. It has to get better. A lot of the times it is hard to feel appreciated for the work that is put in
﻿three month anniversary, * Flexibitly * Diversity * job security and advancement * work life balance * pay and benefits, the drivers (always having something negative to say) when they are not even working for uber as the company they are partners... however working for Uber as employees we are always looking for a way to make things better for the drivers, For your experts give them other ways to advance in the company not just in the expert I II or III. help them find ways to advance in the company in other ways
﻿Low income to cost ratio bad customer service, Completely flexible work schedule, The Jacksonville Area is over saturated with drivers Rates are too low which makes it difficult to make any real money. I end up living day to day trying to keep the vehicle fueled and maintained. Also trying to get help from customer service is VERY aggravating. It is hard to get in contact with them and then when you do they brush you off with a predetermined response to key phrases., Support your drivers better and realize that Lyft is in this area even if it's area of coverage is limited. As more drivers switch to lyft you will lose that advantage.
﻿Good for freshers, , , 
﻿Solid and Good Job!, The people that I work with are all amazing. Everyone is always in high spirit and makes the days go by so fast! Uber is also always changing and expanding and because of that there are always new projects on the go. Makes for a fun and adaptive environment to work in., The team that I am part of is very small and there isnt too much room to move up or around. I would have to move to a larger city to see more career potential with Uber. More a city con than a company one., My manager is a star! She is probably one of the best bosses Ive ever had!
﻿Uber tech yearly review, Great people to work with smart and team players. Management also great growing company and options to move on within the company and great benefits, Lack of communications between departments Hourly pay is not enough., Get a stabile office to work instead of moving us every 6 months.
﻿Time Flexibility and High Income, - Work your own hours - Make good money - Interact with new people everyday which could lead to other opportunities, - Setting a set schedule can be difficult because there is no oversight - Market in Toronto especially is becoming very saturated not as much money as before, Offer more perks to the Uber Partners
﻿Uber is horrible, you work on your own time and you get what you put in, they literally rob you of your earnings up to 35%, please stop robbing us
﻿Driver, Flexible. That's where it stops. Don't get enough trips nor $1 per km is not enough. Uber staff will tell you off on emails if you make a mistake., Not enough pay. Don't buy a new car to drive Uber you will not make money. Guarantee in the web site is a lot of BS.. Uber will find reasons not to pay this., Increase the minimum trip fare. Increase the per Km from $1 to at least $1.50. Treat Uber Drivers with respect.
﻿Communication breakdown, Quick payout up to 5 times a day, A communication nightmare that ultimately ends up in a repeating loop. You can talk to no one written dialog only. Any CS rep will respond in the written dialog so you can have 5+ CS reps talking to you and they'll even contradict each other., Manage actually SPEAK to your drivers when they have an issue.
﻿I enjoyed working here, Making your own hours is convenient, If you are unable to find riders you can actually be making less than minimum wage, 
﻿Uber driver review, Flexible schedule quick money new face and new conversations. Weekly and or daily pay incentive bonuses weekly possibility of recieving tips, Your gas is not compensated traffic may sometimes be an issue customer support is very unreliable and difficult to work with the occasional rude passenger, The uber driver support chat could be worked to assist driver with the current and past trips. Better compensational rates for drivers

﻿GLH Expert 1, Stay busy. If you love helping people and have massive empathy., Too much favoritism. And no room for growth. Promises they never keep.

﻿Sink or Swim with Values, - You get to be part of a historic change in the way people work. Whether that change is for the good will be up to history... - Some of the engineering challenges are interesting and hard and being tackled by few others. (Lots of other challenges are being tackled by lots of competitors and I don't know whether they would be better to work for.) - Guided by a strong mission and set of core values. If you believe in..., - Apparently a lack of transparency. I was oblivious to all of the scandals that have been in the news lately which disturbs me. - If you don't believe in all the values you won't fit in. The values are basically not available publicly and I don't know if they are shared with candidates during recruiting so make sure you find out what they are. - It seems like the IPO may be more elusive than at other startups...., Be honest and forthcoming. In this day and age the truth will out sooner than later anyway.
﻿Low rates for drivers, Convenience! You are your own boss., Driving stress. Traffic. Pay from your pockte for all expenses incudig gas insurance car maintenance. Rates getting cheaper and cheaper., Increase benefits for partner. Don't reduce the prices any more. Over saturated market. Hard to make money. Keep your partner happy for a successful business.
﻿Not so great., Decent pay great benefits supportive peers., High stress level out-of-touch management poorly developed processes minimal training and a false sense of community., You could manage the turnover rate if you took time to learn the CSR's jobs and listened to their ideas frustrations and suggestions.
﻿Amazing place for work, benefits and environment culture and values, Low pay rate feedback and training, Great management team
﻿Expert 1, culture team amazing company, All jobs are not like this one, Keep up the great work
﻿Uber, Uber prepares you and gives you the assets to succeed within the company. Theres so much room for growth that it keeps you extremely motivated to try your hardest to expand your knowledge within the Uber brand., I honestly cant find a Con in my personal experience., I am extremely satisfied with the new updates and how connected we are to management the communication has improved tremendously.
﻿Partner/Driver, , , 
﻿Expert 1, Awesome place to work with a great culture, Share info a little slower, Update us before you drop new things so we are prepared.
﻿Community Support Representative, They actually take care of the employees., There's always people who don't take so much care about the place., 
﻿Extra Grateful, Great environment the company really offers good working conditions and benefits. So far it's been cool beans we work really hard but we also get time to chill., We need a new Ice Machine., 
﻿Uber Expert, flexible schedule casual work environment catered lunch good people to work alongside, Could make more money somewhere else, Needs more growth opportunities or need to get paid a little more
﻿Uber Expert, Uber is a great place to work. The people are amazing and the environment is challenging., Not being recognized for the work you do and the experience you bring to the table., 
﻿Uber Eats, Able to work anytime you want., Pays 650 up to 850 . And promotions only lasts two hours . Batterie dies in less then 1 hour online so you need to have 2 portable charges. People rarely tip you. No holders for mobile phones so you need to have your own. Needs to pay $30 for the bag  so maybe in 6 trips you can pay.App freeze a lot., Pay more. And prolong the time of promotions.
﻿Senior Engineer, Pre-IPO company business doing well, Uber is one of the worst places I worked in my career. I read a lot about the reviews before joining company thinking that all that is personal experience. But it did not turn out good. Managers keep changing competing teams work environment is competitive in unhealthy way to the fact that you will not enjoy day to day interactions., No advice as culture cannot change that easily.
﻿Senior Software Engineer, The company has an awesome and clear mission. Knowing that your work directly impacts mobility of millions of riders and income for millions of drivers is extremely motivating. In addition working on innovation towards a robotic company is awesome. The environment is perfect for working towards challenging problems and there are no politics. Extremely talented and intelligent people around., Personally i cannot complaint about anything., Improve PR. What Uber is inside is not well projected to the outside world.
﻿CSR feedback, Work/ life balance culture & values., So far I don't see any, 
﻿Uber doesn't care about anyone but themselves, It's easy to decide when you want to work and when you don't., Uber reduces the fares which effect the driver's pay but at the same time raises the booking fee which goes right to Uber., Give at least a little consideration to those who make the rubber meet the road.
﻿Stay away from this company., Company is growing fast. Lots of technical challenges. Less of legacy baggage., Politics. Too much of it. Left the company within a year since I could not handle the continuous nepotism criticism etc of work. We are expected to work like crazy and anyone who does anything other than work is frowned upon. No work life balance. Not worth joining now that the upside is also not much. Recruiters talk trash of Uber being a $500 B company in the future. I would be surprised if they even sustain their..., It's high time to cut the non performing cities businesses and focus on improving the business. Uber does not need to be the best everywhere in the world.
﻿I love my job, , , 
﻿hvac, I love it because there are a lot of opportunities in that field., nothing it is my favorite field., uber
﻿Awesome job for avid programmers, - Top notch work quality - Extremely smart colleagues - Very good salary - Awesome incentives & perks - Great growth potential - Travel to San Francisco for training, - None as such. If there is some issue top management is very keen to hear and solve it., Keep up the good work.
﻿#beyourself, Young teams with amazing knowledge Great atmosphere with social priveleges Team binding every month Tandem which will upgrade your skills Work which make you happy when solving problems #beyourself all the time, After 3 months - none for now. Not saying that they won't appear. None job is perfect :), Keep making magic guys
﻿Part-Timer Soon to be Former, Can work when you want. Gives you something to do when you're bored. Met some awesome riders. Learned many new shortcuts through town as well as where all the new restaurants/bars were. Initially a nice way to make some extra money., Ratings-You are at the mercy of people who can be entitled idiots. You can't please everyone. Your contract with Uber should not be based on this. This ratings system is ridiculous. Lack of human support. - All of the canned responses in Uber support does not make up for the fact that you sometimes need to speak with a human. The canned responses are out of touch with driver needs. Wear & Tear on your car Dealing..., The rating system has got to GO or at least be changed. In what world exactly is a 4.67 a bad rating? In Uberworld of course! Nothing in life is perfect. Riders aren't perfect and neither are drivers. Some people are vindictive and entitled. You also can't please everyone. Feedback needs to be available to drivers!!!! Why can I not see feedback? And no I don't mean the canned nonsense that you find on the app. I want...
﻿Uber Schmuber, None that come to mind., Uber saturated the local very small market with referral incentives. Too many drivers not remotely enough customers., Stop saturation of market.
﻿Company Review, Fast moving company you will learn a lot of things in a short period of time where it takes many years to learn in other companies., Company org structure changes frequently due to various reasons internally and externally it makes harder for employees to catch up., Pay more attention to the voice of employees make some adjustment to adapt to the size of the current company
﻿Driver, You get a brand new car through exchange leasing., The payments are too high on cars like almost 700 a month. It's hard to find an insurance company and including insurance that's about 300 a month which is about 1000 a month. Even if you have your own car you still don't make much money because there are so many drivers and people sometimes are very rude and creepy., 
﻿Awesome Place to work, Fast-paced dynamic challenging Fun and Very rewarding environment. Sense of accomplishment and growth. Superior Health benefits Food Snacks Rides... I finally found my perfect environment!, Only for people who like a challenge and thrive in a rewarding team environment...Not really con is it ?! :-), Keep up the great work and culture.
﻿Brand Ambassador, Cool space and free snacks., My supervisor was out sick so wasn't sure of what was going to happen to me., 
﻿Their Thieves, None this company sucks big time go to lyft if you actually want to get paid, They rip you off majorly they charge the riders a higher price than you actually get paid for trip wise they come up with tricky ways to take what you earn from them. I drove 16 hours a day & barely received any pay from them & I was getting back to back rides. Some times they would make a excuses on why they didn't pay what was owed to me., Stop ripping people off
﻿Awesome place to work, Working with a small but awesome team, Lots of work as working in small team, Great but can be improved
﻿Great place to stretch yourself to new heights, Exciting opportunities to grow into various roles. Real end to end exposure. Teams are highly motivated and driven to achieve high results. Passion for the cause is immense., Long hours and tight deadlines can get stressful at times. Time management is key to success at Uber. People have the tendency to absorb themselves fully., 
﻿Business Development, Really fun environment that provides you with the tools to succeed in the role, Contract position means no benefits, 
﻿Good Place To Work, Fun laid back environment with a good work culture., None really. Left as I wanted to get out of San Francisco., 
﻿CEO and Founder, No Pros for Uber Eats, They Shut your restaurant Becuase of your Age!!!, Worst Company Ever! I was a restaurant partner with UberEats and they shut me down due to age.There was no age limit in the polices!Curse You UberEats!!❌❌😡😡
﻿Does NOT compensate drivers use of tolls, Set your own schedule. Decent pay, Every single time I am directed onto the 495 express lanes. Uber fails to reimburse it. Even though my trip routing shows my location they can't ever seem to get this right. I always have to email in and argue with 4-5 different overseas tech support people. Literally a different person for every response. These uncompensated tolls add up to a massive chunk of your paycheck. Drivers beware! Uber will not cover..., Implement tipping pay drivers when they use the toll road. Fix your 495 express toll detection problem. Improve your tech suppprt
﻿Rideshare Associate, -Very flexible -Very convenient -Can make decent cash, -Pay for own expenses -Can become slow at times, 
﻿Uber Driver, , , 
﻿Finance, Great working atmosphere great people and great company culture., Long hours but in a very nice environment., Keep it like that!
﻿Not bad but not worthy of 5 stars, Better than minimum wage most of the times and benefits that come along with being an Uber driver. If you like driving this is the job for you drive people around sit and listen to music etc. Lots of free time and flexible schedule you're your own boss., Sometimes the pay can be almost equal or less to minimum wage especially with the price of gas counted in and other fees you may have to pay let's say for your car., 
﻿Senior Admin, You're working with the brightest minds on the planet benefits perks and attentiveness to both physical and mental health as overall well-being is unlike anything I've seen. Its absolutely mind-blowing to see your work almost instantaneously changing the world!, It can be intimidating., 
﻿Operations Manager, Good Brand however it has worsen, Terrible Culture and very young people, 
﻿Driver, Leaving Uber for other car service to work with, Cheating with Customers and Drivers : for example if the actual fare is $20 They tell customer the fare was $25 and they tell the driver the fare was $15. I have proofs if someone needs it I will give it to them use against Uber illegal acts with drivers and customers And I am already filing a complain against Uber for federal trade commission for cheating with taxpayers customers and drivers., I think they have to leave New York for their illegal acts they shouldn't be allowed to serve in New York anymore and should be given a big fine and all drivers and customers should be compensated correctly
﻿Uber driver, Uber it's good because of the flexible hours., Sometimes you get to deal with some rude riders., 
﻿Driver, Unlimited work surge prices incentives, Some times the app malfunctions., iOS version of the App needs improvement.
﻿Uber after three months, - Amazing people: smart driven helpful ambitious - Impactful work: transforming lives and cities - Trust in the employee - Rooting for you to succeed, - Leadership needs improvement (at HQ), 
﻿Data Entry/ Tech Support, That is has a excellent work environment along with a wonderful staff., That this was only a temporary position, 
﻿Partnerships, - Invaluable experience - Flex your left and right brain no matter which department you are in - Working with a bunch of type A players is a roller coaster ride but love the thrill - Regardless of position you are expected to be able to run with the team and help out where needed - Collaboration amongst cities countries and regions are amazing. Lots of learnings and sharing of knowledge catapults your career..., These double as pros depending on whether you love the challenge like most of us do :) - Long hours - Breakneck pace - Lack of structure (build your own), Keep fighting the good fight.
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Nothing new, Flexibility meeting new people extra money, Wear and tear of your personal vehicle no true company support no stability or reliability. If there's a technical issue with the app and you're unable to get rides there is no compensation for your time., Take better care of your drivers and reward those with consistently high ratings. Offer bonuses for those that drive on a consistent basis
﻿Biggest scam of the century, Independencegood for short periodsin between two jobs meeting new people, Too much mileage almost 40 percent deductions unfair comments from riders for which you cannot explaincan't choose wether to pick up or refuse a ride sometimes travel for 6 kms for a 2 km ride not beneficial coz too many drivers time for pu and drop not considered appropriately not good for full time if you do the maths you are left with nothing at the end of week. Toll rates are paid but always short of actual...., Open a call centerpay the driver ers properly stop recruiting new drivers be fair let the driver ers explain for any comments from riders.
﻿Delivery, , , 
﻿Driver, Your own flexible schedule and nothing else, Driving around for uber it is not a great idea ideally you interact with nice well educated riders but it is not always like that you will also interact with a lot of rude people with lack of education intoxicated who will puke in your car(the cleaning fee uber gives you doesn't always cover the real cleaning expenses) some of them are very disrespectful but you have to be nice to all them so you can get a good..., Review your business plan think about drivers too not just about your profit.
﻿A very mixed bag, It's genuinely really rewarding to work as the liaison between Uber and it's drivers. Sometimes these are simple and easy interactions such as ensuring compliance within your state or providence. Other times you'll have to have difficult conversations with our drivers about why they can no longer drive with us. To have helped drivers meet their goals maximize their earnings and do this all on their own time really..., Our HR department called People Ops is horribly inefficient and barely existent. I was accidentally hired on as part-time though I should have been full-time. My direct manager has reached out to People Ops numerous times and cc'd me on each one to confirm this and have the transition. To this day I have worked no less than 40 hours a week. Needless to say they have completely forgotten about it and have not responded..., Reinvest in existing company infrastructure to provide more transparent communication better the resources we tell employees they should have and harness the idea of long-term employee growth.
﻿Horrible company to work for., Only the customers and Uber win the driver loses., It's a horrible company. There is no way to earn money. With all the driving you do to and from a ride you always lose money and never get a real income you get revenue but no real earnings., Increase pay rate per mile so the driver makes twice the write off amount 1.07 a mile after your 25% cut.
﻿Poor System for Drivers, -Flexible Schedule -Weekly Pay (should be daily), -unable to use someone else's car for Uber if your name is not on the pink slip even if you are on the insurance as a secondary driver. i.e. spouse's vehicle / family members vehicle. -No one to get ahold of when you have a problem -Riders being rude or ignorant including damaging your vehicle (drunk people scratching car by leaning on it to walk etc.) -By laws constantly changing with little to no notice from Uber..., -Make a better resource for Driver's to hold Rider's responsible and to get support with sign up documents and by-law changes.
﻿Not the Best Far from the Worst, Free Lunch Ride Credits Great Overall Work Environment Great Time Off Policy, No Advancement Opportunity (Most people stay contractors for years)  Managers lack management skills Needs more diversity, 
﻿Fast paced dynamic and engaging, * great people * great product * great perks and benefits * diverse * dynamic * high energy * continuously improving, * misconstrued values * some unilateral thinkers * performance process, Practice conscious management reduce reactive behaviours reduce telling. Focus on asking the questions and not having all the answers; demonstrate true curiosity and interest. I think leadership is less about enforcing and more about inspiring through deep connection with the people.
﻿Great to work for, Great for people with hectic schedules that need a little extra on the side, Company was great but found self in uncomfortable situations., 
﻿DO NOT SLAVE AWAY FOR UBER., Flexibility and thats seriously it. I don't see how this is legal employment its a joke. Oh and i just love the 3$ fares to the laundry mat., Destroy your car terrible terrible pay. After gas and extraordinary high fee's you will make 5-6$ hr and watch out your insurance might not pay up if you're app is on., Add a tip feature like lyft. Uber is a terrible company
﻿A Bernard Madoff Ponzi Scheme on Wheels, Drive On Your Own Time, 1) Supposedly based in CA so why is there always a problem with Geico insurance! 2) You never know which Boost rate you've actually earned BUT that doesn't matter b/c Uber robs you of your Boost fee anyway. EX: make $12.53 (base fare) +$9.87 (Boost fee) -$7.71 (UBER FEE!) = UBER STRONGARMING THEIR DRIVERS and demand that the drivers receive no trip after travelling 15 miles for a delivery and walking up 4-5..., GET YOUR THEIVING CRAP TOGETHER! GET YOUR CUSTOMER SVC TOGETHER! GGIVE THE PROPER BOOST FEE - IN OTHER WORDS: DON'T TOUCH IT AT ALL OR TAKE 3/4 LESS! MUCH BETTER RATES AND PROMOS!
﻿Driver, work on your own time, must drive many rides in order for the money to be worth it, better compensation
﻿Driving for Uber, Great if you want to work for yourself and set your own hours. On demand work is great if you want to pick people up especially on surge. Uber Eats is not so bad if you manage to pick up the food get to someones home and then have to cancel the trip since they do not wish to pick up their phones or answer heir doors to get the food.... free food for drivers :), Get to destroy your own car to make some money. If you don't drive right you will make less money than being able to pay off the car + the cost of maintenance including gas. If no surge there is no point in working. No tip option. Get time outs for not accepting rides 30 minutes away while there is a massive surge where the vehicle and driver are at. Ubereats requires finding a parking spot to get the food some..., Put in a tipping option. Get an improved public image. I'm not really sure why management can't get anything right. Any other company has a great image and great leaders. This company treats everyone like dirt. Get rid of ratings and scare tactics of telling drivers and riders tipping is not allowed stop preventing drivers from receiving requests to pick people up in a surge. Improve the servers so that the drivers...
﻿Poor engineering culture, Interesting unique problems to solve, Too many overlaps internal fights ..., Encourage collaboration reduce internal fights

﻿Uber driver, You can work a very flexible schedule., How much charged per mile is out of you control., 
﻿Unstructured, The medical benefits are superb the exposure to other countries is there and the opportunity to gain experience is there., The uncultured culture the extreme lack of structure the unchecked need to grow too fast and the lack of guidance, Proper structure is in dire need provide the proper time and space for learning leaner amount of platforms to use take all matters raised by staff seriously and practice quality over quantity
﻿Overqualified people being underpaid - terrible culture, Great on resume. People especially the later hires are very driven and intelligent., WORST CULTURE people are grouped and divided. Lack of all hands on deck communication. Hires many contract workers and treat them as less visibly. Most people are also very overworked., Company culture needs a lot of work the hierarchy is evident and demotivating.
﻿Great company, Great company to work for very friendly environment, Management will let u go for no reason with out warning, Keep great employees get rid of the bad
﻿Fast-paced; never a boring day, Working with Uber an adventure - you do different things and meet different people on a daily basis. Cross-functional and cross-regional work are facilitated by transparent discussions and collaborative team members. Be part of the online revolution., A lot of processes are still unstructured. Ghosts from Uber's startup past still haunts the company's reputation worldwide, Show the world that you actually care and mean it
﻿Employee centric company, Work culture delicious food :D Free uber rides!, A lot of experimentation is done constantly Once a startup now becoming more corporate, Policies have been made very efficiently here management should monitor these policies effectively.
﻿Great place to work, -Great enviroment. -Oportunity to grow. - A place to develop your persolanity. -You can be yourself., Nothing at this moment. I am very glad., Keep doing this amazing work!!
﻿Working at Uber, This is the best place I've ever seen! Uber is fully worried about employees' experience working in it and this is visible not only with direct employees but with partners (as drivers) too! Love this place!, I think I've only a very personal comment which is about the time it takes to me to get on the COE. Nothing more., I can only advice them to continue with this great family we are nowadays.

﻿Go for it if you like challenges and a highly dynamic environment, - Fast learning curve - Freedom to develop projects and skills - New challenges everyday - Perks, - Salary under market given the quality of the team - Work hard without paid extra hour, Management should recognize internals more for leading roles
﻿Love driving with Uber! Very flexible. Great benefits., You can work when you want. Great way to earn extra cash or make a full-time living, People don't always treat you well. You have to be able to handle difficult or inebriated customers., 
﻿Working as a Driver, Flexible schedule make your own hours and directional function works wonders, Not enough compensation for car fixes and no input for ideas., Provide assistance to drivers
﻿Uber driver New York, Flexibility. Handling school kid and work . You can earn a decent living when you know when to drive where to drive and accept all requests, Can be sent anywhere when online. Sometimes what you ask is different from what the "expert" understand. Drivers need more understanding, Give some credit and consideration to drivers who were with the more than 2 years
﻿Driver Support, It's nice starting with a new company to get in from the ground up, Lack of direction in a customer facing environment. Management is not aware on how to manage employees., Work you complete should be thorough on employees
﻿Amazing so far!, - Work on self driving technology (absolutely interesting stuff) - Close knit co-working environment (Pittsburgh) - Get setup with whatever you need (macbooks standing desks headphones etc..) - Great work-life balance - Uber credits, - No 401k (however you're compensated with equity), 
﻿I love working in a team of smart enthusiastic people, The people are really positive smart and enthusiastic. I love the collaboration and team spirit. I also love solving real-world problems., Obviously Uber is still a start-up (even though it's a really big one) and it has grown a lot so many people are very inexperienced (even though they're super smart and hard working) and some things could be better organized but I am optimistic about the future., I don't think I need to add anything new after all the events from the past weeks I think the management knows quite well where we can improve. I also look forward to learning who will be the new COO who can complement Travis.
﻿Amazing Technology and amazing People, exposure to lots of knowledge and new ideas . people that work here are very talented and have an amazing drive to success! they are also amazing people to hang out with !, there is not much to say that i do not like so far! i think there should be more gym perks but thats about it!, lets take that step forward together and we will be invincible !!
﻿Program Manager, Hustle no boundaries on what you can do freedom to choose which problem to solve, Processes can be vague emphasis on a hacky methods versus quality and depth, 
﻿Its a nice company, Professional team mates. Excellent management. Very good technical knowledge, None that I can think of, 
﻿Driver, Work when I please Meet new people Good for women, Gas jerks wear and tear on your car, 
﻿Great company to work for, Open-floor concept in all offices. Makes it feel more like a community than an office space. Hours are great and the pay is enough to get by with. Opportunities are endless but only if you're willing to move., Not a lot of growth in the city I am in. If I want to move upward I would have to relocate and I'd rather not leave my home state for I want to see it grow exponentially and contribute to my community and be close to family and friends. I love where I live and I don't want to give that up at this point., Try and take some more time to hear out some ideas we may have to bring more business to our respective markets. Plenty of times there have been where ideas were great but never even considered. We want to help make this company more successful with bold ideas and strategies. I feel as though this city has great potential but it's not being seen by anyone else but those who are physically here in the city.

﻿Driving Partner, Great hours and meeting new people, Not enough rides not knowing where your next destination will be., Fix app to allow driver to either accept or decline the destination.
﻿driver, , , 
﻿Don't EVER work for them, extremely flexible and can work as much or as little as you want, the company is constantly lowering their fare rate so the drivers get screwed more and more. If you don't follow the EXACT route that the uber app suggests they wont pay you for any extra distance traveled even though the uber app always takes the slowest route with the most traffic. Overall have been extremely frustrated with uber and how little respect they seem to show their employees, Happy employees make for better customer service. You are making it completely miserable to work for you and you are choking us with how little you continue to pay
﻿Its a Great company to work for, Great environment great management great benefits after learning the job you will find yourself dedicated and committed to wanting to learn more about it., dont really have any downs for Uber its a company that has continuous growth and always changing, 
﻿Easy money, Great conversations and easy way to make extra money., Unlike other ridesharing services Uber does not allow tips through the app; only in cash., -
﻿Company Is Selfish, Absolutely no pros unfortunately, Poor communication outsourced but wasn't upfront about it poor listeners had 401K setup but did not match asked for a new manager as mine second one was awful request denied. It was awful., Messy company. Felt under appreciated not listened toand kept out of the loop on all important matters.
﻿Uber is a huge disappointment - definitely not great, Your customers are for the most part pleasant amusing and interesting... if you are a people person. There is a lot to learn from your customers depending on your driving location. And you get to call your own times., The pay is horrible. The first night I worked I made only $9/hr. This does not cover fuel costs to drive the customer nor the cost to get back. It does not cover wear and tear on your vehicle. And in the event of a mishap by a customer an accident insurance parking etc. etc. etc. that is not covered either. So the question really comes down to... should I flip burgers or drive Uber. Oh! I should also add..., Treat your drivers with more respect. You can charge more and take less. In fact... you should allow your drivers to negotiate a better pay.
﻿Uberx Driver, create your own hours instant pay easy, drunk passengers waiting for riders uber eats, If you advertise that riders can pick up a snack then give drivers a reasonable wait time fee similar to a taxi driver's $40 an hour opposed to 75% of 13 cents a minute like 5.85 an hour or whatever it is...slave labor
﻿Was great grew too fast and became Google-like, Many very smart motivated people to work with on big problems; if you're on the right team. A very fast pace of change. Nice albeit overly-flashy facilities. The best-run IT department I've ever had the pleasure of working with., Many of the best engineers have moved on due to the chaotic work environment and management favoritism toward those creating new things rather than successfully implementing or running things. Middle management is not supportive in any way. Managers will find and latch onto your flaws using them as justification to keep you from receiving raises or promotions. Several teams are traps existing only to provide their..., Start investing in the people inside the company. They're what got you where you are today. Be more supportive of people and help them with their flaws instead of using them as a point of weakness to take them down. Stop re-inventing the wheel with your own in-house tools there are plenty of hard problems to solve at Uber without making more.
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Smart people great workplace overly complex infrastructure, Smart dedicated people. Everyone here seems to really care about doing great work Supportive environment. Your coworkers want you to succeed Important work. Most employees are working on critical things that make users' lives better. Independence. In my role as Senior Software Engineer, Complex infrastructure with poor documentation. Coming from a small startup there was a big learning curve (1-2 months) just to get comfortable & productive., 
﻿Not worth it, make your own hours flexible, very cheap service it's good just for the rider. You make very little money and you work like a dog long hours. For a 40 minute trip you can make $5 after the uber fee and taxes. Is it worth it? No, Raise your prices to $2.5 a mile
﻿Check Your INSURANCE, -Good Company -Potential to make good Money - Flexibility, -Miles on your car -my insurance policy did not cover me for commercial use - Uber's Insurance should be higher and match my $35 million in umbrella, 
﻿After 3 years still super motivated, + Work with the best talent + Free to speak share opinion & ideas + Hyper development of your skills learning + Independence and incentive to create + Sense of purpose and impact + Strong cultural values, - Unclear career path - Your friends will keep asking you about Uber a lot, 
﻿Great for students., Flexible hours are great for students., Depending on location or time the pay., 
﻿FEMALE DRIVER, You can pick your own work hours, The Customer Service help and Rating system for Drivers is TERRIBLE! Drivers only help contact is through the app email. The Customer Service is people from INDIA? Riders can be disrespectful rude cuss and be drunk then they and can rate you however they want? Not fair!, Give more support and take better care of the drivers. Allow riders to be able to tip through the app.
﻿Great extra money on your own time but don't plan on doing it long. Horrible company., Flexible schedule work as much or as little as you want you are your own boss as an independent contractor for Uber, Incredibly manipulative company. They change terms and pay structure at any time. -They say the closest driver based on GPS gets the job when a passenger request but this is not true...they will give it to a driver with a lower paying bonus structure who is farther. -You don't know how much the passenger was quoted for a trip and you are often paid less than you should. When you contact support it can take multiple..., Management is clueless what it's like in the real world working for Uber. They think their shiny pretty app does it all when drivers are actually suffering from below minimum wage returns and poor support. I think Travis Kalanick's recent issues are only the tip of the iceberg. He thinks he knows better than anyone else because he was the creator of something that he obviously doesn't know how to manage.
﻿Very friendly environment and hight level of engineering skills, I'm really happy how high skill level of engineering we have in our local office as well as in HQ. Also everyone in the team is very friendly and I would say that we have quite healthy atmosphere in the company overall., I don't have negative feedback for now., It feels that performance review process could be upgraded but it's still quite good at the moment.
﻿It was good when it was trending, , , 
﻿Best Place to work, i got a leasing specialist position with uber like 3 months ago and i think i made my best decision so far  it is an impecable company to work for  nice manager nice co workers they treat there people soo good, I dont have any thing to say here soo far, 
﻿General Manager, It is a professional organisation. Doing the business well in India. There is ample growth opportunity., Has not spend much time in India. Have also to concentrate in the smaller cities for business growth., Nothing as such
﻿uberX driver, freedom to set your own hours, more car wear and tear then making money. less then minimum wage, treat your drivers better
﻿Growing but at what cost?, When I first started at Uber I was really excited and knew that there would be a ton of opportunity for growth professionally and I knew it would be a challenge but I was ready to work hard. When I started in 2014 you could feel the energy and excitement which has mostly gone away at this point. There are still a ton of great employees there and I made great connections.

It's sad - a lot of good talented people are being treated..., Take a look at the leadership that you are currently hiring and when chaos ensues on their teams that is a red flag.

﻿QA Analyst, Has great benefits and perks., Salary is not competitive  only engineers get paid what they are supposed to., 
﻿It's occasionally a good job but it's tough when there's too many drivers., Flexibility work whenever you want. Interaction with interesting people. Everyday is never the same sometimes it's an adventure. Drive to places you normally would never visit., Not reliable source of income. Too many driver the app should notify the drivers when they're are too many on the road., Allow for tips.
﻿Greenlight Coordinator, Absolutely terrific. Making and celebrating cities everyday everymintue, Need to tone down the brashness to ensure all parties related are happy, Keep up great work
﻿Awesome learning and great pace, Makes me want to be smarter and better everyday. Working with one of the smartest and most effective workforce., Pace of work may be too fast for some people, Doing well keep it up
﻿Cool, Loved it for the while, Pay could be increased more, Pay more
﻿Great overall exp., , , 
﻿Driver, work when you want. get paid weekly, low pay. customers can be ignorant, better pay
﻿Growing pains, Lots of autonomy and seemingly flexible workplace., Still working out lots of issues internally especially related to career development and opportunities. Many moves are "lateral" and don't actually relate to advancing your career. Non-engineering employees that have been at the company for a long time still have significantly lower salaries than new hires performing the same function., Look inward to fix problems before overextending outwardly. There is such a thing as too much growth too fast.
﻿Good, Not call center as usual in Egypt, Plans are changed very much we don't know the timelines for the new career opportunities also hiring app not working., Make it easy to move forward to other teams for new leads you should have a periodic meetings with the teams to know their feedback about the management style
﻿Not good in fortaleza/ce/BR, you can macke your own time, 25% to uber is too much, 
﻿UberEATS, -unlimited snacks -daily catered lunches -reception room -, -No way to move up and become a regular employee -Add commission to the role and up the wage--$15/hr is fairly low for no commission -No job security or stability--You are replaceable! -No PTO (so even when everyone in the office gets paid for a 2 week winter recess you will not be paid), Hire people that come from diverse backgrounds and discourage political bullying in the workplace. If you want people to stay then you must hire them on full-time and give them the same treatment as regular full-time employees. Train your new hires even contractors about the Uber culture and background. Training was very fast-paced and sink or swim. I had to ask a lot of my coworkers for help on my first few days...

﻿Uber is one of the best decisions I've ever done., Great people great company fast learning... super excited to be here!, Sometimes the amount of work is overwhelming.,

﻿Ops Manager, Fast pace culture. If you're looking for a company where new ideas and fast moving product are the norm Uber is your place. Tons of perks and the Chicago office is well positioned in the West Loop., Fast moving means uncertainty. If you're someone that loves working in startup culture then the job is for you but if not then you'll struggle., Keep doing your thing!
﻿Exciting work and great career potential, Smart people to work with; supportive leadership; opportunity to work on interesting projects and sometimes even to build / shape things rather than just following an established procedure without knowing why., Cannot think of any. Long hours during busy seasons but that's universal for all finance / accounting jobs., Keep up the great work!
﻿CSR Emploe COE Costa Rica, - Excellent work environment to grow. - Competitive salary. - Good working environment., - Very competitive environment. - Insufficient equipment to check in according to schedule change, More personal feedback.
﻿Really bad experience, Free food and snacks provided daily, Management that has no idea what they're doing or how to treat their direct reports. Very disorganized and mis-managed. The people who are promoted to managers tear and claw their way to the top but don't care about their direct reports. People are catty and cliquey. It's like a fraternity/sorority for adults! Travis Kalanick is a disgrace and I would rather be unemployed then work for a CEO like him.,

﻿What..are you retarded?, Inspires people to work for themselves, You're basically working on the same system as credit card interest. You're adding miles to a consistently depreciating vehicle that your making payments on., People are dumb and you manipulated that as a market niche props to you. But is there any way you could lobby against a living wage so your drivers can actually survive working for you?
﻿Driver, You can pick your own hours and be paid the same day. Interesting passengers sometimes to name two things, Horrible customers sometimes too much wear and tear on the car pay averages with expenses on maintaining car to around just $10 per hour., Provide car maintenance expense and increase the pay
﻿Great for problem solving not great for a career, **Smart People** Smart People solving complex problems, **Culture** The culture at Uber is not healthy.

﻿Inspiring place to work, * Opportunity for impact. The per-capita impact for each engineer is higher than most other tech firms. At Uber each engineer has a real impact to the company's bottom-line. This really drives the ownership culture and is inspiring to see. * Culture that promotes standing up for what you believe in. If you feel strongly about something the company encourages you to voice your opinion even if there's a large discrepancy..., * Longer than normal hours (compared to other SV firms like Google and Facebook). The longer hours aren't imposed. It's more like you feel inspired to build or improve something that you own. * Bad brand PR. Uber is one of the most villified tech companies. While most employees believe these opinions to be based on misinformation it's demoralizing to know some people see Uber as the "bad guys"., * Re-think brand management. We need to promote ourselves and highlight the positive impacts we make in cities. I believe Lyft has been doing much better than Uber when it comes to this. * Keep standing strong. Even if there are those who oppose us I and most other employees believe in the company vision. Thank you for having the confidence to stand up for the company and its values even when the going is rough.
﻿For people with high working drive, Best working environment in the world Limited free Uber trips, Progression is not very good Low salary No bonus, NIL
﻿Vicious rating by riders, Time spent on work is up to yourself. Has the ability to put extra time for extra money. 60% of riders don't use the ratings which is good as all they want is a ride from A to B., There are 10% of riders that you will never please. some are rating 1 for very minor or insignificant things. Drivers are blamed for App issues., Drivers should have an opportunity to explain/rebuff the reports made against them. Also anyone who rates a driver 1 or 2 should automatically be detached from the possibility of matching again. This will show up the riders who are overly using the 1 and 2.
﻿Uber, Work when you want. Yay, Lots of expenses. Oh no, Pay more
﻿Recruiting Coordinator, Good facilities free lunch decent hours at times, Role could be high stress as recruiters have a lot of pressure managers are very young hours can be bad (was there until 8pm some nights) but not always like that.

Biking is dangerous and you can get injured from falling on the road or worse get hit by a car., 
﻿Good for college students, you can make any schedule, no guaranteed pay for your time, 
﻿Uber, It has flexible hours and one can gain customer interaction experience. It also delivers decent earnings., There's no fixed income which makes it a little harder to earn., 
﻿Frustrating due to lack of answers, One of the benefits I enjoy from working with Uber has to be being able to cash out daily if I'm running low on cash. That is a definite it's perk., The main down side that I am running into is trying to obtain" Trade dress". I have been driving since November and have not been able to acquire stickers in order to legally drive for Uber. I have sent numerous emails and even entered my info so that they could mail them to me but here I am unable to make money due to never receiving them. I was driving without them u til I was notified via email as a response to..., When hiring new drivers they should probably issue "trade dress" at the moment of hire. Also it is unclear regarding sign on bonuses. Another issue that I have never received an answer about.
﻿unqualified management, - free lunch - uber discounts - benefits - office - good hardware, - inexperienced management - unfair promotions for unqualified employees - work life balance - stressfull environment - low equity package for those who work there on non-engineering jobs, Please stop promoting unexperienced employees to the managerial roles and don`t promise to candidates something that you are not going to give them when they start working for you.

﻿Customer Service Representative: Good Job Until..., Work From Home Flexible Schedule Full-Time Fairly Friendly Online Atmosphere..., Outsourced almost all CSR jobs to a cheaper labor market (Manilla Phillipines specifically), Even though they "offered" us unemployment benefits without challenging any of our claims my advice to management would be to NOT FORCE YOUR CURRENT EMPLOYEES TO TRAIN THE EMPLOYEES THAT WILL BE REPLACING THEM! Most of us knew this was what you were doing and we were not happy about it therefore didn't try very hard to help the new office learn.
﻿Restaurant Partnerships, In-office perks flexible schedule full-time, Room for advancement the pay, 
﻿Software Engineer, very innovative technical stack and good, no flexibility in terms of working from home, na
﻿Great Flexibility, The job provides absolute flexibility if you like riding a bike it is as if you were not working, Sometimes there are not a lot of orders therefore you are just waiting in the street for orders also the payments per delivery are gradually decreasing as well as the incentives., Stop decreasing the earnings per deivery give better quality backpaks

﻿Uber is not a job its an under-employment expense!, App to find clients is good, I signed up for uber and they would not honor the luxery vehicle fee they said it is not an option in Fresno CA. I did 1 gig. From my home town I activated it for the first time and my first gig was to pick up in Reedley CA to destination Sanger CA. Round trip was 30 miles country roads time of round trip 1hr. 2 gal. My cut of the fee was $9 no tip offered and according to uber rules we are not to accept tips. So..., Make it a real job! With fair compensation and benefits.

﻿Working for Uber in a Small to Medium Sized City, You get to work your own hours choosing what days what time and for how long you work. Good income on weekends particularly at night when bars are busiest., Income is not very good during week days in a place where the vast majority of people drive. It can be frustrating if you have a string of bad luck with riders canceling when you're half way to the pick up location or just not showing up., Maybe putting a cap on how many people you hire (if you don't already) in a given area. This would ensure that drivers aren't wasting their time when there's already more than enough drivers out. Also putting some kind of penalty on people canceling trips past a certain time 3-5 minutes perhaps.
﻿Fun when it was small, Friendly people fast paced company, Could treat contractors with more respect, 
﻿Chaotic but great, This is a great place to work - great people flexibility to work space to be yourself and incentives to be creative. When you be here you will feel as working at home., This is a chaotic place so you will need to structure the company., Starting structuring the post office is a great idea. Sometimes you will working and don't even know what your position is.
﻿Driver, Able to earn according to your own diligence, Car maintenance and wear and tear, Keep improving
﻿Exploitative, A certain level of freedom is afforded though if you want to make enough to live you will likely work all the time. But I suppose you are free to decide if making enough to live is important to you., No benefits. Constantly decreasing share of revenue. Driving for Uber is like playing out a morality play on the law of diminishing returns., I wouldn't presume to offer advice to management. They know EXACTLY what they are doing and they do so unapologetically.
﻿What a pleasant surprise!, People are great they make me feel like a valued employee compensation is fair to good benefits are extremely good company is growing and changing all the time opportunities abound., Stock options would be nice if we ever IPO., Keep on treating us well.

﻿Good Company, Good place to work now, none for now i think of, None
﻿Challenging and Fast-Paced Workplace, They provide so many opportunities both locally and globally for you to grow and develop yourself while helping the company grow. It's also very fast-paced and results-oriented and it's always about quantifying your results., The work-life balance is quite difficult to attain. This company is not for the faint of heart and they will ask a lot from you because you are supposed to be top talent., Continue the current landscape of meritocracy and growing talent but also scale the operations by hiring more people! Would definitely lighten the workload when there's more people in the team.
﻿Driving for Uber, Make your own hours. Easy app to use., Don't allow tipping and only get paid every 2 weeks., Allow tipping. It helps pay for gas and daily expenses.
﻿Get a 9-5 job! Especially in indy!, Flexible schedule... apparently I have to add 5 words for pros but that's all I really got. There isn't any. At least in Indiana there isn't. I used to make 2000 weekly in other markets come to Indiana and I make less than $200... double the hours double the wear and tear. Is it really worth it?, Uber office in Indiana is a JOKE! Downtown location. Don't know what to do half the time and just says let me ask support you ARE support why do you need to ask? I worked in 3 other markets and by far never had experience a lack of knowledge nor care for a company than working in Indiana. I'd rather drive to Chicago or Nashville to get help on issues then deal with Indianapolis office location. They don't need one. You..., Get your head out of your butt and act like an entrepreneur but wait you aren't. Obviously the difference. Get better management at the Indianapolis location that KNOWS how to make the market better besides on Saturday 😡
﻿Aboard The Rocketship, Big Co Horsepower Little Co Agility, It's hard not being the smartest one in the room... (but that's not all bad), Continue absorbing competition... it's going to take more than a village this time.
﻿Partner Support Representative, Great company around great minds. Trendy energetic atmosphere, In this role I was not offered benefits., I can't give advice here because they're doing everything they need to do. I would say it'd be great to offer PSR's benefits but I understand why they aren't offered as well.
﻿Owner of uber cars, Flexible hours meet interesting people, Vehicle repairs tons of overhead hidden costs vehicle depreciation belligerent customers people vomit in your cars constantly getting fuel tons of car washes, Stop lying that you make alot be honest about risks and hidden costs in driver position compensate for wear and tear on vehicle
﻿NO SUPPORT AT ALL, you can make some money and hope you get paid eventually, Uber does not have qualified IT support. They have robo-support and support from outside the US who don't read English or understand what you're saying. The Green Light center is staffed with dummies. I went in three times walked out with three different answers none of them right. I drove for Uber Eats for a couple months. I asked the Green Light center to fix me up with an Uber X account so I could work for..., My advice to Management is GET SOME MANAGEMENT. TRY HIRING PEOPLE WITH ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IN TECH SUPPORT.
﻿Refuses payout, Flexible hours Start and stop anytime, Have to go down to the office every week to chase payment Refused to pay a group of us during the Tampines trial scheme whereby us riders were given a flat rate of $16/hr for working with no Trip-Per-Hour requirement. Several weeks of chasing later the management refused to pay us on the days when we were unable to make any delivery (As a new area that just opened up certain days come and go without any delivery especially..., Pay timely
﻿marketing manager, Excellent opportunity to share best practices, kids with spreadsheet making un-wise decissions, culture wise need to walk the talk
﻿good start-up, intern has a lot of opportunity to manage own project., the salary is too low.,

﻿Garbage company false promises, flexible schedule work whenever you want, You will destroy your car People will treat you like trash Uber will promise you the world and won't deliver PLEASE if you are considering doing this DO THE MATH Just because you are making $13-$14/hour gross does NOT MEAN you are really making that much! You are likely making much less than minimum wage. Car depreciation is real! You car can lose over $200 of value for every 1k miles you drive. This is money..., Pretend to care?
﻿30% Pay Cut Effective 1/1/2017, Flexible Work Schedule. Be Your Own Boss. Customers are Fun., 30% Fare Cut as of January 1 2017 Resulting in a 30% Pay Cut to drivers Because UBER passes 100% of their fare cut on to it's drivers. Short Rides $3.20. ( 5 -12 blocks ) 5 minutes Medium Rides $4.60 ( 20 blocks ) 10 minutes Medium Long Rides $5.60 ( 27 blocks ) 12 minutes Long Rides $20 ( 30 minutes ) UBER Pay does not even cover the cost of your gas!, Increase Fares 30% and pass the 30% increase on to all drivers.

﻿You get what you put in - there is no room for growth, -You are part of a team that actually makes a difference in the bsuiness -The company puts a lot of money in making employees feel valued -The skills you learn here can be taken into any of your future endeavours -You get recognized for hard work -Casual environment no dress code -Free snacks catered lunch once a week -Everything is Apple (Macbook work phone etc), -No chance of moving up (even though they make it seem like you can) -Sometimes the work can get repetitive -Work politics (as with any work environment) -Physical office is always moving so I feel like an orphaned child with no home -Contractors are treated like second class citizens (even though they run most of the business) -Obvious racism, 
﻿Policy, Only here since 3 months but already 300% in it. No 9 to 5ers here for sure. Everybody acts like an entrepreneur. Hours and predefined roles don't count. If you have a good idea it'll become your project. Whatever happens great career step. Expect to get more requests from headhunters, On-boarding process : here is your laptop now go to work. Don't come here if you can't keep up with the pace of a highly demanding and ambitious start-up. People stay less than 2 or 3 years., 
﻿Amazing adventure!!!, Impressive/admirable people and environment hustlers leaders problem solvers the most amazing team Ive ever seen. Amazing how everyone truly cares about people and want the best for everyone inside and out the company to each part of our business., so far so good need adapting skills to understand the business and growth, 
﻿Worked at Uber for two years and gradually became disillusioned by disturbing elitism I saw in the Seattle office, Snacks nice office and free* Uber rides. Great for the resume if you don't mind all the negatives., In a nutshell: a shambolic mess of self-interested management dismal treatment of contractors favouring of outside hires and elitism., Reassess how UberEATS in Seattle should be run learn what transparency means and remember that delivery drivers are people too.
﻿Amazing Place to work, The people that work here are so welcoming and so easy to get on with anyone would fit right in. A big pro is the free food :D, I don't have a bad word to say about Uber. By far my most favorite job!, Stay as cool as ye are :D
﻿Working at UBER, - Good Health Insurance (Dental Vision) - Credits for rides/EATS; unfortunately they no longer offer the $333 to new employees. Those who started after 1/2016 only receive 15 free rides a month (max ~$18 each but depends on the city in which you work), - People Ops / Employee Relations (HR) is comprised of completely incompetent personnel. Dunderheads. Probably not everyone in the department but definitely the ones I have unfortunately had to deal with during my time here. Fairly certain they have little to no knowledge of labor laws and employment standards; I have never felt confident in any answer they've provided me or my coworkers. Further there have been..., Let Builders Build!
﻿Alright for Extra Money, Make my own hours and money on event weekends is good., Uber seems to be only interested in the customer and doesn't treat its drivers very well. If there is an error they will always side with the customer., Be more attentive to drivers
﻿Community Operations Specialist, Such a friendly company which doesn't force and disappoint its employees. Many opportunities to grow. Awesome please to get into, Improvement in everything is required from time to time . So I'd like to say everything can be improved slowly to make the company newer day by day., :) No advice's. You best management knows what and when to give. So no comments.

﻿n/a, flexible days and times .off, no benefits no insurance no PTO, give partners more compensation than 25%
﻿Great Company, Great flexibility with working hours, None to list at this time, 
﻿Uber has excellent management, You are not pressured to take a long way at all, You can easily get in accident using the app while driving. I am a safe driver but I almost got in accident rushing to pick up the passengers before they cancel. Also most of the time there wasn't a good designated pick up aria. I didn't make as much money easer., It has been a while so I can't think of any. I just remember that they were professional and saved me from taxi company slavery
﻿Good, Work is a gig puts bread to the table roof over my head shoes on my feet. Money in my pocket god is good., You actually have to physically get up every morning and go out there and make that Buck is not a virtual world this is not Nintendo folks, Spread the bread

﻿Lots of Perks Low Pay - UberEATS Sales, Work Life Balance Lots of Perks (catered breakfast and lunch lots of events), Low hourly wage and no commission, Start paying commission and take the sales team on full time.
﻿it's the 'payday loans' of jobs, choose your own hours instant pay (although unreliable)every once in a while you'll get a fare worth the time gas vehicle wear and tear, deceitful business practices unresponsive 'help' for partners.( up to 4 full biz days to receive incomplete responses to questions or problems.. no such thing as a human to contact via phone or IM once you are a partner) Uber Pool often times just means you get paid half or less than half for the same ride. I.E. northside of Chicago to South loop took 35 min I earned 2.15 Claims Uber makes about cancellation fees..., probably pointless the business model assumes drivers will be unhappy or unable to continue with UBER for long and the long term plan is to eliminate the need for drivers altogether. I'd say the model is probably working perfectly and as soon as you get those pesky needy whiney partners out of the picture the real money will start flooding in. Perhaps remember that all of those drivers you are aggressively seeking...
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule and easy job, Atrocious pay. They tell customers they don't have to tip and 99% don't. On top of that they take a 35% commission off of whatever you make. I worked at 1.3X rate and 1.5X rate at the busiest areas of Los Angeles for a very long day and didn't make close to minimum wage., ENCOURAGE or at least don't DISCOURAGE customers to tip. Find a balance between customer satisfaction and driver satisfaction. The commission percentage is ridiculously high when drivers (speaking for myself at least during surge pricing in busy areas) don't make minimum wage BEFORE WEAR AND TEAR on the vehicle.

﻿"The proletarians have nothing to loose but their chains. They have a world to win.", You get to be your own boss., Your wages are very low and your losses are very high., Care for your employers and pay them as if they are human beings.
﻿Driver, good schedule nice customers mostly, can't set pricing. expenses of driving are high, 
﻿Good experience, , , 
﻿Uber if you have to, I had my own schedule my own car and had fun driving people around., The cost benefit analysis is way off. After calculating wear/tear mileage gas and TAXES I was averaging about $7.50 - $8 per hour., 
﻿Pathetic Culture, Great Brand name. Exposure to some great problems in the industry., There is very little to learn. The company is full of new college grads who hardly know how to write maintainable code. The company has a very little sense of direction and believes in throwing money at every problem. The CEO believes that employee should at least put in 80 hrs/week. No work like balance., Fire Travis. Get a mature CEO who is humble and knows how to run a business without throwing money at everything.
﻿Driver, You create your own work schedule. No micromanagement, You put a lot of miles in your vehicle., None
﻿UberX Orlando FL not worth driving, you make your own hours, lowest fair in the coutry Work long hours if you wish to make any money, Uber created a "no tip culture " if one can't make any tips driving in Orlando for $0.65 per mile on UberX  one the lowest pay in the country howis it possible to make any money? 25% of that goes to Uber about $0.20 goes towards gas another $0.15 goes towards vehicle maintenance wear and tear cleaning etc. Honestly what is the point of driving Uber?

﻿Hustling and productive, You get to exposed to lots of tech stacks from Python Node to Go and Java. You get to learn things super fast tons of opportunitis to learn open source tools and data engineer pipelines., Not too much cons. Putting way too much effort on product features instead of long term investment on the engineer culture. Maybe it's just my team.,

﻿Uber Review, , , 
﻿I would recommend Uber to anyone!, Young company Good atmosphere Great opportunities, Huge Lack of clarity of the processes also we would need a data base more updated and clear than Teamdot, 
﻿Drive for money, Chose times to work. No, Customers treat you like service help. Car pool customers are especially poor at social skills and public etiquette. Many are snotty immature and downright patronizing., Stop reducing pay and reward drivers with more compensation. Communicate to riders that we rate them and that we can deactivate their accounts if ratings drop.
﻿A life saver in a hard knocks world., You can work as much or as little as you need to. You can set your own hours. Customers really appreciate the service., There are no benefits. The best money earning times are high stress like after big events or at bar close. Customers can be very demanding at these times., It would be quite helpful if there was a place on the app to add tips. Customers would happily tip if it was an option.
﻿Contractors are treated as second class citizens, Fast moving workplace Exciting things to work on. Always something new., Doesn't obey laws. Moral issues. Talent isn't top knotch, 
﻿Risky and Rewarding, , , 
﻿Operations Manager, Very passionate environment with lots of rock star colleagues. The working environment is very exciting. If you are a startup guy here is a top choice., Work hours are bad basically you will spend 7/20 working on your staff., 
﻿Uber, A great concept made hellish by owner's greed and short-sighted visions of glory. I like meeting new people and I enjoy the conversations I have had with some of them., People beg you to speed up so they can make their apt train plane etc and then give you a low rating for unsafe driving! Some self-centered idiots think they own you because they are paying you $5 to haul them and 10 bags of groceries from Target to their home. When you factor in the cost of maintenance and fuel you often end the day making $10 an hour. Also: it is very deceptive to count time actively driving only..., Make Travis an honorary "founder" and get some real businessmen in there who won't kiss his bottom.
﻿Overworked underpaid, Good coworkers all very capable talent better put to use elsewhere., Markets to employees attempting to convince us we are working toward something good and meaningful so they can pay us less than what we're worth., Pay more.
﻿Uber treats drivers poorly, Work your own hours dah, Drivers have no idea of the destination or the rider until pick up so the driver in many cases actually loses money. Riders can give false information as to pick up location and take drivers on a wild goose chase. Uber does NOT compensate drivers for these wild goose chases. Uber does NOT offer bonuses for great performance but UBER consistently send threatening messages to it's drivers. There is no assistance for..., Drivers should get a minimum of 5 bucks per ride. When riders cannot provide directions when navigation fails drivers should receive a fee. Uber should have a hot line to speak with a live representative. Uber should start giving back to the community
﻿Uber Driver, flexibility with days and hours worked, lots of miles and wear and tear on vehicle, give more incentive bonuses some kind of appreciation.
﻿Fantastic Organisation, Struggling to think of any!, Keep doing what you are doing!, 
﻿Uber sucks, Nothing they don't work with the drivers, Everything They don't work with drivers Unprofessional, Try reading the emails before responding to them
﻿Good but challenging, you're surrounded by some of the smartest people you'll encounter. Your an owner from day 1. there is a strong company culture. The best place I've been so far for self improvement. In 3 month I learned more than 2 years in another company, If you don't want to play the game of the company culture etc. it will be difficult. You also need to blur the lines between professional and private spaces. Many people took pay cuts to come here, On HR policy try to be less US centric and adapt the model to all countries. Continue to limit bureaucracy as much as possible
﻿Driver/Partner, Set your own hours. Work when you want., Wear and Tear on your vehicle. Company extremely unorganized. Lack of system of communication and assistance for partners., Create a functional system that works and have an open line of communication with partners.
﻿Good pay but no tipping, Fast simple and fun you just deliver either food or small packages, Uber says not to tip your drivers! What kind of company says that we go inside a tall building go all the way up to 40th floor and not get a tip that's not cool, Management is awesome they are always there to help
﻿3 Months - Loved it, Amazing company it has been the best professional experience in my career it is unbelievable that Uber can grow at this pace and keep the highest level organization that I have work with. It is a pleasure to be part of this company at this journey to change peoples lives all around the world., For those who love what they do no cons at all but you will work as you never did before what for me is another PRO!, Keep being hustlin!
﻿Make money machine, I decided how much money I want to make and how long time I want to work not office not boss not limitation on nothing, Any kind of benefits, Best option on money makes
﻿You're basically working to just make money for Uber, You can make your own schedule, Customers think your car belongs to them and they can do whatever they want in it After paying for gas tolls mileage and maintenance on your car you barely make anything for you. No spiffs No benefits, Look out more for your employees. Lyft offers more ways for you to make money and they always look out for you

﻿Operations intern, Nice working atmosphere and great learning path, None None None None, 
﻿Uber discriminates in hires, There is nothing positive about working for Uber. CEO is a jerk., They cut me off in middle of ride. No class. Even then it was difficult to find out why Was because of arrest though there was never a conviction., Quit discriminating based on arrest with no conviction.
﻿Great place to work at!, Fast paced. Incredible peers. Decent food. Disrupting company., 25000 person "startup"!! Grown too big too fast., 
﻿If you're looking to grow and be challenged this is the place to be, Lots of smart people and challenges to solve. Amazing growth and impactful work., Culture could be improved but really depends on the group and your manager, 
﻿Uber, Conveniently located near public transportation., Culture culture culture and public image., Work life balance is important human beings need it.
﻿Uber Driver in Lexington KY, Not going to get rich but good part-time job ($10-20/hr) in Lexington KY. Work as much as you want whenever you want., Not compensated fairly on some rides. Not potential for tips through app., 
﻿Uber is the BEST place to work!!!, Uber has changed my work life completely challenging me and making me grow everyday. Plus the team is AWESOME! Feels like home., Office is a little far from home., 
﻿UBER DRIVER, Flexible schedule 99% passengers are friendly, UNDERPAID! When they send trip requests atleast let us drivers know from the pick up to drop off location. Sick of driving 10-18 minutes only to have a 3 minute trip for bloody 3.71 cents after the 25% uber cut. Ridiculous. We should know how long and where we are going. I am a 4.95 rated driver one passenger made a fake complaint about me saying i was wreckless and did donuts while on trip with them?!!!??? Uber did..., Get your act together uber. Not long until all your drivers see how shady and stingy you are. Im out.
﻿Awesome first job, Learn a lot great teammates (your mileage may vary) very driven people. Get thrown in the deep end very quickly in the job. Will pick up a lot of skills here the experience changed my life., Long hours. Quickly moving to becoming a large (bureaucratic) company. Get thrown in the deep end very quickly in the job. Did I mention long hours?, 
﻿Uber Driver, You do not have a fixed salary or base that can give you an economic security, It's a job on your own, 
﻿Driver, Any times work love talk to people, No rider  bad weather traffic, Get busy
﻿Unreliable support for contract workers, The hours are flexble and you can begin working very quickly, Extremely glitchy software and little to no support to drivers when issues occur, Take care of your drivers as well as you try to take care of your customers
﻿Community Operations Manager, Flexible flat org. almost all the team members are manager level, Bossy boss information controlled by very few people, 
﻿Confortable job, You gone be a tourist guide..!!, No paid for short canceled rides, 
﻿Driver, Best flexibility you will find in a job. Good pay depending on region., The competitive nature of Uber and Lyft makes things difficult to an extent. certain incentives Lyft offers are superior such as the driver power bonus and the guaranteed hours, Mimic Lyft's incentives.
﻿Okay, Interesting fast paced motivating work, Lack of work life balance, 
﻿No diversity at all fraternity like culture, Good opportunities to learn Interesting challenges, No work life balance No diversity No growth opportunities especially for women or minorities Toxic culture, Cultural values are a joke 14 cultural values created by 2 white male executives Take care of your people you're no longer a start-up
﻿Management Doesn't Care!, Snacks are good catered lunch., Management will treat you like just another number. Company culture is nonexistent., 
﻿Uber Driver, Work when ever you want you get what you put in love the job meet new people make friends get to travel a lot lots of crazy stories, Car maintenance adds lots of miles to your vehicle you'll deal with rude people every now and then. Insurance for Uber has a $1000 deductible. GPS systems sometimes is inaccurate, Develop a more sophisticated GPS and have better insurance for the drivers
﻿Be happy about what you do, Happy and comfortable environment helping every one around to be better., Being addictive to work makes you crazy about it., Be as you are do not let any one to make a miss with what you have accomplished so far.
﻿salary, , , 
﻿Driver, Good working schedule but have to work long hours, Working for less than minimum wage, Get out of your office and drive for one day see how much money you really make.
﻿Deliverer/recruiter, Excellent pay and flexible schedule., Working outdoors in inclimate weather., Provide more bonuses and advancment to people committed to long-term employment and recruitment.
﻿Community Support Representative, Salary perks atmosphere at work: excellent team, - Lack of personnel and professionnal development through the position - Shifts (evening) and 10hours/days schedule can be change quickly as the business is growing fast - Lot of opportunities promises many times by management but nothing happened -, Your employees are asking to answer many forms and provide feedback but use it for real really listen the problems and look for solutions
﻿Everything you've heard about Uber is true - doubly so for the LA office, Workload is fairly light compared to other areas of the company. If you play your cards right this is much less than a 9-to-5 job if you're good at acting like you're working during the day. In addition no one checks your work in this office. This is a byproduct of most colleagues being completely checked out and not having the mental capability to understand anything beyond basic arithmetic. For what it's worth..., Most of middle management is completely incompetent. This is because the competent individuals have left for HQ so only mediocrity is left. This office also promotes heavily based on seniority so if you're neither I recommend you look for another job. Surviving in this office has nothing to do with merit. It is more important to fall in line than to do anything substantial. Keep your head down act like your boss..., Front line managers need to be leaders whom colleagues respect. We can choose to act like the stereotypical Uber management team and promote a bunch of yes-men/women or learn to truly lead and promote leaders whom people respect and want to follow.
﻿Great place to work, Lower pay relative to industry, Pay more, 
﻿Maintenance Manager - XLI, - Open culture - Flexible - Responsible - Ownership experiance, - Stressed - high working hours, - Load distribution should be observed
﻿I'm a newbie, I pick my hours direct deposit meeting new fun people., None so far. Hoping it stays that way., Just don't mess up my account like it seems has happened with other drivers.
﻿The best place to work, Fun and creative working environment, None of it I am happy at Uber, 
﻿Why Uber is AMAZING!!, This job is probably my favorite one that I have ever had! The culture is amazing. Not only are most people friendly here but they all have great passion for what they do. I have made not only work friends but a couple have become personal friends as well. Yes we all love the free food everyday however I truly believe that Uber is a place that makes dreams come true! I have seen so much passion and excitement in myself..., The hours are long and sometimes I am exhausted but I also get 3 days off so thats a plus!, You guys are amazing! I cannot wait to see how you play a part in the growth of Uber as a whole!
﻿Partner/Driver, Flexibility of schedule and very easy, The application requires multiple updates but this is to be expected and it's for improvement, 
﻿If you love motion this is the place, Yesterday is History and Tomorrow is the vision. That is what Uber is about. Always Hustlin' to find a way to become better with lot of empowerment to employees., Too fast for the people who are too slow., Keep the rigour on
﻿Sexism and incompetence, Flexibility good equipment  learning a lot about bad people, Only women could be seen and get credit even with mans doing The samethings and having The exactly same skills. But what was ridiculous and discrepant were the procedures when men and women made mistakes. Any male error was passive from severe punishments such as dismissal and the same mistakes of women were left aside. All with knowledge of two ccos misandrias and incompentents., Hire people with sense of justice and ethics otherwise you Will have Disappointed employees
﻿Pro's and Con's, We are working on super interesting projects and people are highly encouraged to own their own projects and take charge. There is a high potential to grow and learn both because senior members are very good at what they do and are open to mentoring and teaching junior employees and because you are dropped into hard projects and learn how to do advanced things through trial by fire. People are really smart and passionate..., There can be political issues on some teams. People can get very competitive cut-throat and bro-y. It's definitely a place where your appearance of working and your relationship with higher-up's hugely defines your success., Don't allow the overly competitive environment where people don't feel comfortable speaking up. Don't higher smart yet bro-y people value hiring people who care about others. You also always feel like you aren't working hard enough and as if you need to put in more hours. Though I think a lot places feel like that.
﻿Community Support Representative, - atmosphere is very good - great benefits - management are very approachable - amazing team of people, - long shifts but you have 3 days off a week so it makes up for it, 
﻿Operations Consultant, Biggest learning platform you can ever receive along with the brand name, High work pressure. No work life balance., 
﻿Restaurant Partnership Representative, Office is nice perks are nice somewhat free to plan your day to get your work done., The noose is tightening and org becoming more strict. Commissions cut by 40% compared to 6 months ago. Increased prices for product already highest in the market. Looked down upon by management and operations team in office. Phasing out commissions in lieu of lower paid call center type positions., Ask for collaboration and opinions from your sales people. Pay people fairly for work that they do.

﻿DVO at Uber & loving it, Uber treats its employees very well. I have had the privilege to work for Uber over the last several months & I have never been happier. Between the satisfaction I get from the work I do to advance the Self Driving Uber project to the benefits & pay I receive for doing it & enjoying being around the people I work with there might not be a better company to work for., I am currently on a 6 day work week which means my days off change every week. It's manageable to deal with but I'd prefer to have the weekends off every week., The only advice I can give to management is to keep on pushing the limits & continue to grow. Uber is a fairly young startup that has done incredible things in its short existence. By growing Uber provides opportunities to grow the world economy and make a difference in the quality of life around the world as well.

It's best during the weekends late at night when everyone is leaving bars or during special events. Encouraging riders not to tip and not offering an area to tip if they want to so if they do you are carrying cash around when the whole system is based around not having to handle cash. Riders often bring it up that they want to tip..., Quit advertising that you can guarantee between $20-$40/hr when you can't most of the time (drivers read the fine print). Intigrate an option to tip the drivers and make it optional. For drivers who are not in the big cities down town area you're drivers are barely making any money after expenses take that into consideration before you make guarantees.

﻿Stay out of politics, Flexible work opportunities enjoy the customer interactions as a driver, have stopped driving for them CEO is aligned with Trump, stay out of politics aligning with religious and ethnic discrimination is counter to my Christian beliefs.

This makes me particularly angry for several reasons and one of the things I hated the most.

The maintenance expenses will come quickly. You need to keep in mind taxes are not withheld from your earnings so you will owe taxes at the end of the year for all of your earnings. Uber has created a culture amongst their riders that tipping is either not allowed or not encouraged.

﻿Best job I have ever had!, - In order to work for Uber you must remain flexible when it pertains to the work schedule. The shifts can change every month since the company is moving forward so rapidly. - Things change week to week. - No clear guidance on what the promotion standards are., - Good job on keeping up with an ever-changing industry. Keep an eye out for employees going above and beyond and remain flexible with the DVOs., 
﻿Not what it used to be... No $ :/, If you have a long commute to work and can set the app to pickup along the way it works out ok... Not great... But OK., Getting sucked out to an airport the opposite way home. The red zones that payed x2...X3...X4. Are gone. When I First worked for them I would get double and triple pay all the time on weekends... Now it's bottom dollar pay in the weekends?!?!..... For dealing with cheap drunks. And that's the girls... Don't get me started on the drunk dudes., $2...$3 rides in the middle of the night?!! Nope I'm done with that. These people need to pony up some cash if we're going to save them from a $12000 DUI. Raise the prices on late nights and weekends. Because it's just not worth spinning my wheels. You're going to loose all the good drivers. I recommend you have a $7 minimum. I think it's fair. $7 that way the driver makes at least $5 after you take your cut.

﻿The Truth About Driving for Uber Full-time, Nice to work for yourself whenever you want and wherever you want. Also you meet alot of cool people and have some great conversations., In Houston it may be a good side gig but no longer a good career due to the fact Uber has flooded inner city and airports with do many drivers airport waiting times can be up to two hours. There is also less surging pricing in inner-loop due to so many drivers available. Also Uber pays drivers less per mile than they began with so pay is low. Uber touts that drivers make $20 per hr. but that only includes time after..., There are many Middle-eastern immigrants and African immigrants working 12 plus hours per day to try and support their family and barely scraping by. Uber is not being truthful about amount made per hr. and should pay drivers more per mile but way too greedy and taking advantage of the poor.
﻿Very useful for students, Schedule flexibility makes it very convenient for students and for people that want to make some extra cash., Money spent on gas and car maintenance could be really high and it is not taken in account by the company., A higher rate for drivers would make more people hit the road. At the end of the day drivers are the ones that do all the job.
﻿Driver, Flexible hours. Start  stop whenever you want, If you own a vehicle... you put lots of miles . If you lease a vehicle you get charged $150-$180 weekly lease plus excess miles fee, Don't lease
﻿Great job, It is a startup within a startup there is a lot you can learn in a short period of time., Poor pay and poor communication skills. It can also be a little cut throats at times., Focus on clarity of exspecations and direct information as things do change and evolve rapidly.
﻿Uber is the BEST <3 !!, Uber culture is fantastic and super Loved!, none none none none none, 
﻿Best company I have worked with, My experience with the company has been magical. Starting from recruiting process I was very happy at the end of the process thinking that if I didn't get the job it was all worth it. On day 3 I was feeling fully ready to deliver thanks to great company values and clear targets. Hearing founder & CEO Travis' insights every week on the staff call has further inspired me., So far nothing negative. Have been super happy with the whole experience. Great people great mission and loving all the challenges., Keep rocking! #superpumped
﻿Customer Operations Specialist, A healthy and fun environment! Working with Uber is a humbling experience. Sharing good practices and open to possibilities., None so far. Uber is just amazing!, 
﻿Not really worth it, Immediate money in your pocket is nice...but..., By the time you average gas and vehicle wear and tear the rides are too cheap to justify., Up cost of rides or take less from drivers
﻿Great Company Culture Not so Great Career Advancement Opportunities, Uber really values all of their employees and will accommodate to your needs. The unlimited vacation policy is great and being able to work from home at times is the best part (and having free rides wasn't too bad either). Each team is city specific (unless directly working for Corporate) and really knows the ins and outs on both the driver and rider side of the app (and that's in any aspect of the team). It's a very..., Moving up in the company is hard. It's easy to get transferred to different cities (or even different countries) for the same position but many of my coworkers (and myself) experienced struggles in finding either a permanent role or a position above a current role in the same city. Essentially if you want a role in another position you have to be willing to go to any city. They have lots of job openings but don't update..., Consider the people that are working for Uber even if they're part time or contract. These people are knowledgeable in the company and in the systems and would greatly benefit the advancement of whichever city they are working. And they are hard working. I've never met an employee that didn't love what they did and didn't love working for Uber. Passion and dedication are such important qualities to have in employees...
﻿Operation coordinator, The managers have all interesting backgrounds and make the environment super fertile for new project, The work is quite repetitive and is not an option for long term opportunities, The position needs to be reviewed in order to give more long term opportunities
﻿Uber driver, I'm an experienced Uber driver in Guadalajara City...., Sometimes it gets a little hard but l know how to drive against the wind..., Let's create a great teamwork....
﻿Driver, I can make my own schedule and earn as little or as much as I would like., The pay per hour is low., Minimize the fee that you take from the drivers.
﻿More Cons than Pros, Uber is a good temporary way to make money in between jobs., To make any decent money ($800 per week) you have to drive 12 to 15 hours per day 5 to 6 days per week. There is an automatic toll system but it does not work. If you are not watching all your tolls you will be giving that money to Uber. There is next to no way to communicate with Uber with questions no email text or phone. The market has been flooded with drivers which has decreased the ability to make money. Now..., Stay politically neutral. Repair all the systems you pretend are working.
﻿Solving big problems but at a high price, The internal tools at Uber are best in class - you can dig into the data very easily the tools are efficient easy to use and very robust. Uber is solving some of the largest problems that exist out there and the scale of Uber is incredible - the company is making a huge impact on the world. The CEO is incredibly ambitious and very driven and isn't afraid to make big bold bets on the future. Generally the..., #1 - Politics - Since the bar is so high at Uber being smart and hardworking is not enough. You must be incredibly good at office politics to be successful - and in fact if you are not good at politics you can expect to be routinely passed on for projects and given low performance. #2 - Performance Policy - Stack ranking is a disaster as teams are compared against each other although they have very different KPIs...., While the company has been able to attract best in-class talent without a serious revamp of HR policies including culture HR compensation and recruiting Uber will slowly go down the drain. The company has already started to see a dip in morale and attrition and if it doesn't work quickly to improve this it will only get worse.
﻿Exponential stress curve, Uber has some of the best tooling in the industry for Engineers. Its extremely engineer-centric as an engineer you're definitely a first class citizen at Uber. Great snacks ride credits and free rides to/from caltrain and after 10pm are top of the line perks. Catered lunches and dinners (although only if you stay until 8:15pm). HUGE growth it's common to see your team double every 6 months., Ever Increasing scope/expectations and constantly fluctuating priorities are not something I'd expect at a company that size. I sat at four desks in my first month and it took me two months to get my first meeting with one of my managers. It's not uncommon to have actual "do this or leave" situations mostly ending with people attempting the task and then being asked to leave. High stress situations like these lead to...,

﻿Great choosing when you want to work!, Drive in the area you choose and work the hours you choose. Your income in basically up to you and when and how long you'll work., Sometimes its hard to go to work when you are not forced. LOL, 
﻿Working Experience, Flexible working hours are great for students or as a side job for extra income., Wish the pay was a little better though. After the daily gas expense take home is not the greatest., Increase the rate for fare for the drivers
﻿The doesn't justify the means for a new car, Good money. As long as you put some away for your taxes and another part away for your car depreciation and maintenance. Otherwise...you lose., You're wear and tear and depreciation is not factored into your earnings., Allow tipping for Vehicle Depreciation fund. lol
﻿Meh side-money, The job flexibility is amazing to say the least. Some fares are great people and others are just silent so they're easy to have as a fare., You are an independent contractor so filing a w-9 is not a horrible but you have to plan and save for it or you'll be horribly surprised come the end of the year. Some fares are just horrid people; mainly those that are intoxicated.,

﻿Great way to earn extra money, Flexible hours Excellent navigation easy to use app get paid for the time you spend in your car, risky job action comes in spurts but not steady throughout the day or week most auto insurance companies won't cover any damage sustained to your vehicle, Allow riders to request drivers that they like. Cover Uber drivers collision in case of an incident.

﻿UberEATS partner, You have a totally Flexible time to work. U can select not to work if u don't feel like working today., Not many orders. The only busy time is between lunch and dinner time. During other period of time u r almost wasting your time and energy., Make more restaurants to join the platform
﻿It's great for A while, I like that you get to make your own schedule and work how hard you want to., I don't like being treated like chauffeur or a robot by stuck people who think because daddy has money they are better than the creepy uber driver, Have some sort of indicators as to where the surge currently is at a particular time because I've spent more time trying to figure out where the surge is located than I have actually in a surging area. That's 😢.
﻿Perfect place to be for job growth in an exciting environment, , , 
﻿Good Until Tax Season, Good money during surge times. Make your own schedule., Don't expect to get your 1099., 
﻿A fun job but it's basically minimum wage or less when you factor in taxes fuel and vehicle depreciation., The job is very flexible and you meet lots of cool people. You also see a lot of the city., Low pay disrespectful passengers too often ware and tare on the car help center is a bot with pre-fabricated auto response so no human contact higher up the chain. Underappreciated a lot by passengers AND Uber and I'd say about 2% of passengers have the courtesy to tip. No exaggeration 2%!!!!!, Pay incentives or bonuses for full time drivers and adding a tip option in the app would keep me around otherwise it's not worth it...
﻿Not a good company to work for., Money is good during holidays only. Can't make $100 a day without working 12 hours a day. Oh is that not a pro., They treat you like a POS. Dont know why the call us "uber partners" they should call us "uber POS". Will take your money out of your account if there is a disagreement. And you have to beg for it back., Add tips. Treat your "partners" like partners not criminals that have to explain every move they make.
﻿Dream Company, Uber is growing FAST. And with that growth comes a lot of change. Every employee whether you're entry-level or an executive has a voice and no matter who you are or what you do the best idea ALWAYS wins. I've been wanting to work for Uber for the last 3 years and now that I'm here it has not disappointed., If you want a company where everything is processed and organized this is not the place for you. Uber is still learning and trying to understand itself internally so you have to be flexible with the ebb and flows. Uber may not be a "start up" anymore but it still runs like one. Which can either be a pro or a con., 
﻿Driver Partner, Work at your own pace days and times. Fares can be good I'm predominantly days so I don't see many surges but I also do see any drama., The new airport pickup process is very discouraging. Some days are slow and the best areas are over saturated with drivers. I would like to be able to earn more as I gain experience., Give drivers more incentives or a bigger share over time. Do something to change to new airport pickup process and finally allow tipping!!!
﻿DVO, pay is decent free lunch food..., random removal of benefits cut throat environment lack of feedback Do as you're told attitude random change of schedule, let us know who you are
﻿Oh the places you will go!, We are literally on the ground floor of this new and exciting technology.

There is always someone willing to help and the perks and benefits seem to be never ending., The Advanced Technology side is a very fluid environment so if you don't like a fast paced consistently changing environment this might take some getting used to., Communicate with the teams that are in the trenches on a daily basis and use our input in future decisions.

﻿uber driver, you work when you want no boss, pay is not what they say you can make, pay for drivers for the ride to get the passenger
﻿Great for a single person with very low overhead, Wear and Tear on automobile can be expensive in the long run calculating this may significantly reduce profits you may think you have made. No compensation for Gas/Petrol. Most of the risk is on the drivers (Contract Job with no benefits in case of injury/emergency) Discourages Tipping :( (Most passengers think it is included) uber has expensive fleet of cars at no cost/liability., Take a smaller cut from drivers 10-15% is more reasonable. Take a note from Lyft they make up for their high cut with tipping ability., 
﻿More Con than Pro, While potential supplemental income may be possible..., In reality it doesn't really work out. You need to work at the worst ie peak times to make any money and it's with riders most likely to puke in your car and expect bottled water for free. When I drove for Uber there was no way to tell how far a rider was aiming to travel and you are only paid one-way making long drives less profitable and unpredictable., Roll-out driverless cars as soon as possible.
﻿Amazing company, To be a part of Uber family means to work among super friendly and highly motivated professionals solving problems nobody faced before., The company is growing very fast and some internal procedures are not perfect yet., Keep moving this direction.

﻿High growth opportunity, Uber's business is growing at a tremendous pace not only is that good for the companies value but it also provides employees with lot's of opportunity to grow in their careers. The mission of the company is clear and the leadership is truly committed to the mission. Leadership is committed to the mission of the company the mission is clear. This is a company of execution and action. Compensation seems fair. They tend..., Definitely some politics and not so great people who got through the door however this part of the reality of a high growth company. Some teams definitely not all don't have the best work life balance. High pressure environment comes along with the pro of the company being execution and actionable. There is a fair amount of politics and people who are "coasting" due to the rapid company growth., Continue to work on weeding out the bad eggs. Be aware of and minimize the political situations.
﻿Current Employee, Challenging fast paced environment smart energetic people growing fast, some inexperienced managers low base salaries, 
﻿Driver, the low rates aren't enough for drivers, quit dropping rates, 
﻿Okay company; pay is sporadic, , , 
﻿Uber Driver, Make your own hours meet great people very low stress, Market saturated with drivers making riders difficult to find. Uber riders are under the impression that tips are included and Uber does NOTHING to address this. Uber doesnt allow drivers to see riders destinations causing drivers to sometimes drive 15-20 miles to deliver a rider 1 mile away earning less than $4 wasting time gas and not even getting a tip! Uber scores against you if you refuse or cancel a ride request., Put a simple " would you like to tip driver for good service? !0% + ()  20 % = ()  30 % = () Etc. Allow drivers to see destination to allow for sound judgment on whether a driver can actually make a few bucks on a long rider pick-up situation.
﻿Awesome place to work!, Always pushing to your career development Great challenges all-day, Sometimes excessive workload but managable, 
﻿Desaption, Uber Great app not company, Uber lies minpleat enslave scerw thier drivers any way they can i got decavatated for no apperant reason Uber should stay away from trying to be A wall street company And just sell the use of the app Just sell the app and let anyone use it You don't have to police your drivers Let the driver and rider determine If outcom is good for both of them No rating system Dose not work You fire without warning Yet you..., Get in contac with your drivers It dose not exist
﻿Partner, Good leads on picking up riders Access to extra money, Communication review driver requests respond on drivers request, Work on responding
﻿self employed, Uber provides an income and gives me flexible hours. im a Driver and until i can get back behind the wheel of a tractor trailer this is what i have ., Im Putting more wear and tear on my car than i had first anticipated. I am a Trucker. I am looking to get back doing what i do best., always be str8 forward and honest.
﻿mostly good some bad, Great office Great energy Meritocracy No micro-management Working with some truly exceptional talent and tenured professionals lots of opportunity to learn and push yourself one of the best places to work in some ways super fast paced (pro or con depending on your personality), very clique-y Diversity some leadership is "stagnant" some management is stretched too thin feels like everyone's just surviving for the equity to hit when they go public culture isn't well defined yet, 
﻿It really not worth it unless you are really hurting for cash, You can get paid weekly or daily if wanted, They don't allow customers to tip on the app unlike Lyft does. It puts a lot of wear and tear on your vehicle that you don't get any type of reimbursement for. The mileage they track for your taxes is only the mileage from the pick point to the drop off. The mileage getting to the pick up site is not tracked for you., allow customers to tip drivers on the app
﻿Fake reviews, Work at own schedule, Minimum wage to beat up your own car. Unsafe passengers. Uber cuts pay anytime without warning., Pray for your souls.
﻿Underwhelmed and overworked, Freedom to set hours  interaction with many different people, Occasional difficulty with customers mobile app and pay scale, Take less money out of driver's paychecks!
﻿Customer Service, Intense environment but generally happy place to work, Can consume your life if you aren't great at work life balance, Keep up the good work!
﻿Uber Driver, When its slow its slow. Gas prices finding uber mileage errors less and less surge., Raise rates., 
﻿To Many Drivers, That you get to choose your own hours., Too many drivers. Uber focuses on signing up new drivers... not providing income for the drivers that are already signed up. Last Saturday night in a coastal resort town about 7 miles in length there were 14 drives. That is one every 2500 feet. No chance to make any money. To much wear and tear on your car.... and with time figured in you make $3 a hours., Focus on the drivers you have and improving your app.
﻿Driver, Make your own schedule. Work when you want to. Get to see the city, No guarantee salary. You have to set your own goals and make sure you get out there. Rare bonuses, 
﻿driver, you can set your own hours., the money seem to be decreasing, charge a little more for uber pooling
﻿Uber internship, * Awesome mentorship * Real world problems * Great team, * Wrapping wrappers * Insisting on hiring seniors while current employees cannot handle all the workload, 
﻿Best Job I've Ever Had, This work environment is the best that I have ever been a part of. Uber's culture encourages creativity individuality and welcomes diversity. I feel like I am a valuable part of this organization and I am able to learn new things and expand my responsibilities every day. I love learning about the company and its mission and even at an entry level I am involved in it all. If I could work here for the rest of my..., The location is far from my home. However all of the benefits that come with the job make it totally worth the drive., I really don't have any advice for management. The management team is the most laid-back team I have ever experienced. There is no micro-management and they actually trust us to get our work done with minimal supervision.
﻿Data Science in Seattle, I've been at Uber just over three months now working at the Seattle engineering office. I worked in a very different field before this so I worried that I'd be behind the curve from day one. Which I was. But working at Uber I've found that asking questions challenging assumptions and being proactive are highly encouraged. I've loved working here - everyday I get to work on incredibly wicked and yet extremely interesting..., The growth of the company has left some of the data infrastructure struggling to keep up. Our queries can be slow to run sometimes and sometimes things just fail under the load. But these issues are minor compared to what I love about working here., Uber in Seattle can feel really different from HQ in San Francisco. I think the Seattle office could use a bit of the SF touch; from how it looks and feels to the infectious energy that is there.
﻿Awful customer service, Work on your own schedule, Everything else is just terrible. They reduce your rates without notice and they give the customer the wrong impression by alerting them you have arrived even when you are a considerable distance away. There are so many couriers now that you can stay online for 8 hours a day/7 days a week and earn $157 dollars! The app after almost 3 years is still buggy and will give a trip to another person even when I am physically..., They don't listen to any type of suggestion so I will not waste my time
﻿Amazing company to work, Great atmonspher Amazing intenrnal tools to analyze your city Great coworkers., If you are not a self-starter you'll not be abel to get a full-time position., 
﻿Avoid the stress, Being able to help people who really otherwise would have trouble getting around ., OMG so many OK well they constantly will under pay you and some how get different estimates of distance promotion  surge. Screen shot everything they love to act dumb and put you through the ringer asking for things like trip ID name of rider pick up location drop of location this is to get you to just give up on actually getting paid what your owed. It feels pointless because a lot of responses they don't even address..., Ya quit stocking your drivers then act all stupid on mistakes . If we both use Google maps how do they always get less accounted for I will never know.
﻿Great opportunity to make money while sacrificing personal time., No boss no schedules no meetings. You are your own boss. Work as many hours as you want and as many days as you need., If you want to make real money you have to be used to be online and available 12-14 hrs a day. Also buy a gas tank every day and putting between 5000 to 7000 miles a month., Offering a better rate for the drivers will be good as well as allowing the end user to add a tip to the final fare will be great.
﻿Challenging and very very fun, I came to Uber with 6yrs of sellside equities experience and I was very apprehensive at first. But my apprehensions were misplaced for the following reasons: 1. Super flexibility...everyone is allowed to work at the pace style method they chose to. Your deliverable is water-tight...but how you get there is your call. 2. Data-intense .... all decisions meetings etc are backed by data which means that no one uses..., 1. if you are used to a very structured and predictable workplace then this may not be for you 2. you have to be a total self-starter and self-completer too (everyone is as overworked as you!), lets hold on to our hustle and passion
﻿Best Job Ever!, Being part of the future Now! Mind blown!, They won't let me work on my days off of course my wife and three kids are Thrilled about that previous jobs made me work even on Holidays., Keep leading us into the future!
﻿A Growing Place., Full benefits place for growing promotion recognizing by continuous monitoring and evaluation., Long working hours. Required travels from time to time and this maybe not suitable to people who have families., 
﻿A really great place to work, - great culture and people - good work/life balance - room for growth, Pay could be a little higher but the benefits do make up for it., 
﻿Developmental Vehicle Operator, #superpumped to be a part of this madness and to be a part of bringing self driving Ubers to the streets. Best things about working here is there's cutting edge technology EVERYWHERE!!! Excellent coworkers as well I learn so much from everyone. Also Snacks Snacks Snacks everywhere for everyone all the time! Not to forget about this benefit package they include for everyone that's incredible. I've got such great insurance..., I'm getting fat (no worries a gym membership reimbursement is included in the benifits package). The dynamics of this business are a bit much in the beginning so things change daily for everyone that takes some getting used to but it is exciting., Some more effective communications. Just so were all on the same page at the same time.
﻿Engineer, It is an amazingly productive environment with outstandingly smart people and a world of opportunities. It feels great to have a lot of funding and support from the higher levels so that the must cutting edge technology can get its way to the market. The best single thing I live everyday is the empowerment of having an impact on the world., It's a very fast growing company requires alert and ready-to-changes mindset, 
﻿Contact someone, Don't have any and if I did I would put them here., Once your working for them it's very hard to get in touch with someone I been trying for over a year to talk to someone., 
﻿UberEats Driver, Quick on boarding allows you to start working and earning pay fairly quickly as they pay weekly. Lots of jobs., Between the Uber fee to use the driver app lack tips and mileage pay is not comparable to other courier companies., Get rid of driver fee. Allows for tips.
﻿no online or call support, make your own hours and the fact you get to meet different people, worst customer service ever no 800 support and they keep pushing you to go online and when you do the people from overseas don't understand you and send you back to webite!, hire people in United States and train!
﻿driver, , , 
﻿Doesnt respect its Drivers, Can work when you want thats about it., Uber encourages riders not to tip so you rarely get tips. Really a poor company. Lyft is so much better do yourself a favor and drive for Lyft instead. Lyft encourages tipping by the way Uber doesnt even have an option to tip and recommends that riders do not. After you pay for gas and the devaluing of your car its less than minimum wage. Only good if you can drive part time an hour or two a day in a surge if..., Try respecting your seivers who are the ones bringing in the money!
﻿delivery, It is a good company to work for, You work according to your own schedule and sometimes we feel like we are free., I definetly recommend this company to anyone.
﻿Driver, Make good money if done right, Rude passengers. A lot of miles on you car. Could pontentially loose money than make money if done wrong, 
﻿Beware of false information constantly!, They will lie about how much money you're truly making. You will spend tons of money on gas and maintenance and get about $10 an hour. Also they'll claim your cancellation rate is ultra high even when its not. Usually really late or when I'm trying to log out it'll send me on the farthest trip or the whole shift., Stop offering "guarantees" that aren't real.,

﻿Do not believe the per hour rate they advertise!, Its nice to meet passengers and get them to their destination safely. The drivers are really nice and generally really kind hearted, The rate is calculated only when the passenger is in the car. It does not include the many hours you sit in your car waiting for a call. It does not include the gas you consume. It does not include the special ride share insurance you are required to have. If your insurance company finds out that you're using your car in for commercial transportation they will deny all claims. Be prepared to put 1000 + miles a week on..., Charge the customer a little more like Lyft does. Take less commissions %. Pass all surge fees onto the driver rather than double dipping on your commissions. Publish a phone number drivers can call rather than sending a canned email response from someone in India.
﻿Pressure, Long hours without sufficient breaks; on-the-floor learning without supervisory oversight so high risk of misinforming the partners; communication silos--as new services or policies take effect support staff has very little time to become versed or familiar with new change before having to problem solve with partners/customers, Do better job with orientation and management should be stronger at operating under pressure and strengthen problem resolution skills., 
﻿Driver, You have to work nights and weekends to make the most money. You pick up a lot of drunks working nights. App doesn't tell you destination of riders which can be very far. No in-app tipping. Job puts a lot of miles on your car. Uber is taking a bigger share of drivers' fares., Allow in-app tipping., 
﻿Used to be great/ not so much anymore.., You can work whenever you want and one some days/ some weeks can make a decent amount., The amount you get per mile has went down an enormous amount over the years. It seems to me that now the wear and tear that you put your car through is not worth the amount you get paid., Please listen to your drivers a little more.. it seems as though you simply do not care what your drivers think anymore.
﻿Uber Driver, Independence with no boss hanging over your head. Pick your own hours The work is there if you want it., Said you can make up to $800 a week for 40 hours but I have not seen that. a lot of own money invested into the job., Pay more money and provide better perks because everything that the drivers have invested..Be more flexible on the ratings.
﻿Great company, Loved the environment and team, No cons for Uber everything was well, Keep up the great work
﻿Happy and content. feel a part of the organsiation, sometimes don't feel making as much impact as could be and can be tough to work for, engage with employees more, 
﻿Driver, You can create your own schedule, It's difficult to contact uber for any issues., 
﻿Development Vehicle Operator / Tester, Poor vague communication. Not enough clarity about how the job should be done. Direct feedback is either non-existent or avoided by too many of the trainers and managers. The preference seems to be the safety of e-mails or texts rather than in-person conversation and many trainees agreed that the trainers' communication can't be trusted. Also the company loves to do things its own way but that led to an elimination..., Get over the fear of actually speaking with people. Too many of the DVO trainers seemed too afraid of discussing trainee performance in person even if asked repeatedly for feedback. This job requires constant clear communication and the example they are showing contradicts that. And be aware that in the vehicles themselves DVOs and even some trainers were ignoring many of the rules and procedures that were important..., 
﻿make money for the company & you go poor, Work anytime you want to work, too many drivers not a lot of calls., 
﻿It is Income, Work when you are available and around any type of schedule, Never are able to interact with a person. All questions and help is done through messaging. Never know where you will be dropping your rider until after you pick up the rider., Improve the app to include destination before we accept a rider. Give more time to accept. Make it easier to contact management.
﻿Exciting company good culture, Uber is an exciting company that is in the news weekly. They have weekly all-hands meetings with Travis fielding questions. This is somewhat unique compared to other companies of the same size. The culture is strong with the best ideas winning., Uber has somewhat lower pay and benefits when compared to similar technology companies. The culture is good but somewhat cut-throat., 
﻿Ripoff, Easy to get started because they rip you off, I leased a car thru uber leasing program and Tampa Honda. I was not given a choice of car and wound up with a 2015 Corolla with stains and burn holes on the seats. The dealership never sent a tag for the car despite me contacting them daily regarding my tag about to expire. They wouldn't issue a new temp tag told me they mailed it out on 3 different dates and NY temporary tag expired. I couldn't drive the car illegally..., Stop your deceptive advertising
﻿#Superpumped, I've been at Uber for about 4 months now and I love it. The people are great management is fair and I haven't had a negative experience yet. The growth opportunities are great and people want to help you do that here. I wish everyone could work for Uber. #Superpumped, None to mention so far, Keep doing what you're doing.
﻿Great place if you like to hustle, Really challenging and valuable work. Definitely get your hands on the operations of the business in a meaningful way. Lots of room to own projects and impact the marketplace., Hours can be aggressive. Generally a fairly high stress environment with aggressive deadline and work quality expectations., 
﻿The epitome of job fulfillment with a wonderful culture and benefits to match, The ATC is a passionate creative and fun work environment. Free (delicious) food and drink. Management is on point and the company truly cares about it's employees. Available benefits packages are inexpensive and widely accepted. Health dental vision life 401k. Lots of room for advancement. You will love coming to work every day!, The only constant here is change. We are growing so quickly and changing so much that it may be difficult to work here without a malleable schedule., You're all handling growth like champions keep it up!
﻿Driver, I can tell 0 pros no anything worth it in this business and company I believe all government must stop uber business, Worse job ....you can do it is uber driver if you want work as a camel and horse welcome  Jesus Christ, Close or correct you business
﻿Not worth it, You can Set your own hours, After doing the math... you make very little... most of the time less than minimum wage... average pay is about .90 per mile uber takes 20%... also dont forget they do not take out taxes.... wear and tear on your car with gas is about .54 per mile.... by the time it all adds up you are lucky if you have anything left.... not to mention the customer service/support is terrible., Pay a livable wage
﻿Experience, Full time employees are treated nicely, Commuting and not receivng full benefits as quickly, Keep up the good work
﻿Happy Employee, Good compensationbenefits and perks which my previous companies was not able to provide. I love the work environment not to stressful and bigger chances of earning more, No annualization No incentives..I hope that the management will include these in the future, keep it up
﻿3 Month Review- Development Vehicle Operator/Vehicle Operator, Free Parking in the City, I have and MBA and 12 years professional experience and this is my professional observation of the company: -You will be serve the same function as an Uber Partner even though recruiters will tell you that you are going to develop driverless technology. -All drivers get treated like they are 5 years old even though most of us have advanced degrees -Only a small percentage of people actually get to test the technology..., You have absolutely failed at developing this position into something notable and special. You preach meritocracy but only promote mediocrity. You fail to develop relationships with your employees and expect them to be loyal to you. Change your attitude about the "lowly" DVO/VO position or there will be fall out with the drivers...there is already talk of multiple people leaving. GIVE ALL EMPLOYEES THE SAME BENEFITS!!!!!
﻿Uber's support team is terrible., You get to work your own hours. Depending on your city you may get more passengers than Lyft., They cheat you out of your money. It's incredibly common. You can check with the Uber communities on Facebook. If you switch phone numbers you can manually enter it on the uber app but if the app doesn't work on any of your devices. The support team will not update it for you. It's been over 5 months and they haven't helped me out. I have documented each email with the team. They all will give you "I'm sorry let me..., You all are incredibly unprofessional. I wish i never signed up to drive. You should be taking care of your drivers since we make you money.
﻿very bad paid! lot of hours to compensate!, get to know the city!, a lot of hours driving to worth it (12 per day...), 
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Driver, You get your own schedule meet new people and of course have awesome talks with passengers, I enjoyed working with them then a customer that I told to put on a seat belt refused to put one on so I had two options at that point take the customer anyway and hope he would be happy or tell him that I can not take him and get a low star raiting and get message by uber saying it's your fault that you could have just taken him so I went with my first option I took the passenger hoping it would be an awesome ride but..., Take a drivers word some time and don't hold it against them or stay true to your word best advice I can give
﻿Great culture! Not for the faint-hearted, You'll have the chance to work with some of the most brilliant people in the industry. Uberettos are fun loving but serious to get things done. Employee perks are awesome!, They are not kidding when they say that Uber is fast paced. Employees are constantly doing more and more work sometimes with the same or less resources. Work-life balance is hard to achieve and stress-levels are always high., Leaders are doing great in communicating cultural values. They set a great example for their people. However leaders should also think about how to retain talent and sustain excellent performance without causing undue burnout. The current working hours and exceedingly high expectations from leaders lead to pressure and sometimes unhealthy competition among peers. Uber is gradually albeit unintentionally creating a...
﻿They don't care about you - impersonal work environment, It was nice to work remotely and they pay training. At least you can get training and info from other colleagues and sometimes from management., Minimal communication No room for advancement The managers try their best to care about you but are limited to the support they can provide because of the grip that upper management has on them. it's like everyone is walking on eggshells at the company., No advice to management will every trump the bottom line. They are making hand over fist so why stop the predatory loan practices to drivers the illegal background checks and everything else.
﻿Not a primary source of income., Work when you want., Uber as a company is very shady and not there to benefit the driver in any way., 
﻿not to do, good money if you pay attetion to your account, pay attetion to each ride in each area, need to get equipment fixed
﻿GOOD, Giving the best opportunity to a fresher, work under pressure means extra pressure, 
﻿Great place to work with great minds, Motivated smart and eager colleagues ambitious and challenging projects many opportunities. High in analytics and tools., Different timezones and therefore very long days., 
﻿Great for students, , , 
﻿Superpumped!!!, - Been surrounded by bright colleaugues always open to listen and help - The continuous commitment to make every process more efficient in an effort to make thing easier - Great culture a big room to grow and the opportunity to take ownership of your own projects - You can start and end the day whenever you want depending on your agenda - The constant challenge with myself to be a better talent everyday in order..., Honestly I don't have anything bad to say about Uber my only regret is that I couldn't have enough time to prove my qualities to demonstrate what I could become for the company keep learning from the amazing people here., Keep changing the world!
﻿Unorganized, Tight knit team - manager does a very good job at hiring people that fit with the overall team dynamic., Politics- doesn't matter how you play it Unorganized - minimal to no communication information is either not there or very difficult to find No real work recognition, Open your eyes and see who really cares about the work they do. Playing favorites isn't a positive thing to be doing or professional. Give people who know what they are doing more responsibility not to the people that set the Green Light Hub's overall performance
﻿Driver Partner., It is flexible. Very flexible. In Las Vegas it is probably more flexible than any other city. 24hrs per day someone needs a ride so you can work any time that you like., The pay. The compensation is awful. As a driver I make about 6.25 each time someone gets in the car. While it is true that there are long rides and short rides the expected value of a ride is about 6.25. So if you do 100 rides in a week you would make about 625 dollars. From the 625 dollars you still have to buy your own gas pay for the maintenance on the car and also you're an independent contractor so you are required..., Charge higher fares. Pay the drivers more money. Do not discourage tipping.
﻿Unprofessional company, They hire laid off bathroom attendants., They don't value or respect the DRIVER! The very Backbone of the whole concept., I would say layoff all of your socalled experts because if having my name misspelled on the base letter is very knowledgeable then this company has no hope. Consider adding autoparts delivery into your repotoire that way when the drivers that stay with Uber cars start to break down they can just start bringing parts to each other.

﻿Best place to spend the first 4 years of your career, - Autonomy - Quality of Peers - Mobility within the org - Speed of execution, - Work Life balance - Prioritisation, 
﻿LOTS OF DRIVING, miles on car must drive a lot to make good money, higher pay per mile, 
﻿Driver Partner, Ease of schedule plan your driving around your time frame. App is pretty decent except the Navigation has let me down once got me a negative review because the client was late due to Nav., By the time you factor in gas and wear and tear on your vehicle your lucky if your making $8 or $9 an hour unless a special event like New Years Eve. Too many drivers in the area now and trips are harder to come by and doesn't make sense to drive around trying to find a trip wasting what gas we do have. You may have a decent trip but it takes out way out of the metro area and no trips available out in the area you dropped..., Better payouts for the driver/partners. We are the ones doing all the work and using our cars and gas.
﻿Only someone desperate or stupid would drive for Uber, Flexible work schedule. Work when you want., Extremely low pay - almost $0 after expenses, Uber does not care at all about its drivers. Unlike Lyft they refuse to include a feature to allow riders to leave tips. If you care about your drivers make it easy for riders to leave tips. Second the pay is absurdly low. I average $13 per hour. However when you deduct 55-cents per mile driven (the IRS reimbursement rate) I earn almost nothing. Drivers should clear at least $25-30 per hour (after Uber's share) in...
﻿Truth as an uber driver, Flex schedule. This is the only pros available working for uber more cons than pros., Uber is not regulated so they don't disclose that they charge the customer more than they show the driver what the customer paid. Complete ripoff but uber knows that if you need the money you will do the job. You work more than 12 hours to make 150.00 a day if your lucky., Stop ripping off the drivers listen to them.
﻿Freedom and accountability, Empowerment in decision making accountability for each actions great team to work with Super cool managers work-life balance Dynamic work culture, Slowly moving away from start-up culture so in some areas things getting delayed Attitude issues at the lower level management which is not seen in top management some people do not fit to the culture cause hindrance to processes, People at cordinator level people should be educated for showing enough maturity and professionalism. Performance management should be made better some people still living in the age of showcase something rather than working hard and getting the benefit
﻿Don't fall for a few pennies!, Availability to get some cash in case of need flexible schedule., Extremenly poor customer service as driver you will never be able to talk to someone in the phone. If you use your own vehicle it will get destroyed and depreciated. Commission porcentaje taken our of your fare is too high. Totally waste of time and money, 
﻿Driver, You can work when you want, None that I found at this time, 
﻿Once-a-decade company; a place to do your very best work and enjoy your time doing it, By any measure Uber is truly a once-a-decade company. Looking at the growth of the business the innovation the leadership and the quality of your everyday coworkers it's unlike any place else I've ever worked and I'm loving it. Some highlights: - Every employee is trusted empowered and given the freedom to drive impact - Transparency of leadership (as seen in weekly all hands/Q&A with Travis) - Career opportunities..., A lot of people complain about work/life balance but in my experience it's gotten much much better even in the last 6 months. There's some disorganization and lack of processes but I think that's because we're growing like crazy., Continue to do what you're doing and keep the culture strong!
﻿Fast-Paced Exciting and Lots Of Work Still To Be Done, Work with really smart passionate people where decisions get made quickly every day. I feel fulfilled doing my job and genuinely happy to go to work every day. Love the flexibility with the company and teams really work together well., Longest hours I've ever worked still has a start-up feel (not a con) so that is to be expected but with lots of good resources. Still lots of work to be done so while we continue recruiting this is normal. Feedback given here is not given sugar-coated and can seem aggressive at times., Keep doing what you're doing. Transparency and optimism go a long way.

﻿Working For UBER, Very efficient straight-forward and professional company to work for., Would be better for drivers if the riders had a tip option in the UBER platform and if UBER didn't take as large a percentage of each trip., Improved phone support.
﻿I'll be homeless soon..., You have hope for a brief moment., Uber is a very crooked very cheating company. I've begun recording everything on paper and have discovered vanishing trips evaporating cancellations (as in they don't even show up in my list) and minutes inaccuracies on EVERY ride. If you consider .30 cents a ride nothing multiply that by the number of rides they exploit their drivers through EVERY DAY. Billions? Actual income for regular 12 hour days is between..., Greed isn't sustainable. You do want your goose to keep producing eggs of gold right? Start spending some of the gold from the eggs you've already gotten on feeding your goose. Don't be stupid. Stop lying to people about anything.
﻿driver, you can work on your own schedule., its all about clients Nobody takes care of drivers very cheap pay no insurance offered, 
﻿Uber Partner (Driver), It is a great concept. Flexibility. Freedom., Compensation. Wear/Tear on personal vehicle. Partner (driver) support. Communication/coordination between partners and Uber corporate office., 1. You MUST stop reducing driver compensation. Riders can currently take Uber for same price as the public bus. 2. Pool is simply ridiculous - for both driver and rider. 3. Giving company two stars for the business concept alone. 4. Beware... Most of your partners HATE you. They will jump on next related opportunity. 5. You are constantly recruiting new drivers because of your insane turnover rates. Those new partners...
﻿Very low driver pay, Can work when you want around other jobs., The pay is so low that sometimes the trip costs nearly as much as the pay in Oklahoma City. The only time this is not the case is during events like the basketball games or if you get the rare tip that uber makes sure to constantly hard advertise to customers to not give. I cant count how many trips paid me less than $2 to $3 dollars which is clearly not worth it to drive to them and then to thier location., Increase driver side rates

﻿A challenging place for engineers, - Organizational direction changes constantly Uber seems to have good vision about the long-term mission but down to specific projects in engineering department chaos is present all over the place - Politics and internal friction is increasing as company culture somehow encourage aggressiveness you need to know how to fight for yourself even you are just an engineer., - Let the employee know that you care about them start from the worst free lunch in valley, 
﻿Driver, Good part time job. You can make around 200-300 dollars on the weekend alone. Uber is good at paying back cleaning fees quickly., Sometimes you have to deal with jerks but its pretty much always on the weekend after the bars close. People damage your car or get sick (also rare)., Keep your car clean. Play good music. Be friendly but I would suggest making people sit in the back seat.
﻿Good for your own schedule but rarely great pay, -Start and stop working whenever you need -Weekly pay and option for daily pay! -Available in many cities, -Not paid for time between customers -Must pay for gas and other wear and tear on car -Hard/impossible to reach Uber in an emergency no number, 
﻿driver, con - no real cons I can think of, non that applies. pretty solid job, 
﻿If you like 60+ hour weeks....., * No dress code * Free catered lunch every day * Snacks in the break room * Games in the break room * Good benefits, * No work-life balance * Pay is far below industry standards * Micro-management * Zero consistency in policies * No communication from managers to CSRs * Increasingly strict rules and regulations * Mandatory working holidays * Only 10 days of PTO allotted per year for CSRs but managers get unlimited vacation, Take your employees' lives into consideration. Don't change policies based on numbers--LISTEN to those people who are keeping the company afloat about what policies and programs would actually work. Appreciate your employees more too. Pay them a decent living wage and give them adequate PTO.
﻿Backstabbing insane entirely focused on appearances, The pay is good and they're great swindlers, There's a culture of complete incompetence with buck passing forever and cargo culting rampant. There's no unifying culture there's just enclaves each worse than the last., Rethink your life and hide from the SEC.
﻿Operations, vacation workspace people pay everything, relatively unorganized; changing constantly company; hard to find your spot, 
﻿Driver, Drive whenever you like and getting to chat with passengers, Passangers can be rude from time to time, 
﻿Great place!, Its a startup environment but like a tech company theres tons of flexibility and trust within the organisation. Work can be tiring and extensive but extremely rewarding and fulfilling., Young company theres much still in process and being worked out processes might not be as set in stone as more advanced companies., To keep being forward looking innovating and also learning from other top tech companies!
﻿Uber EATS driver, -Flexibility -Opportunity to gain more during weekends -Two-way rating (you also get to rate how the delivery went) -Higher pay for distance and time -Great support team resolves most issues, -Do not receive timely requests (been online over an hour with no delivery requests at times) -Customers do not initially provide details how to get to them if they are located in an apartment. -Support sometimes takes too long to respond. -Some restaurants do not have their orders ready upon arrival, -Faster and realtime support -Add more restaurants -Offer instant discounts for gas stations
﻿Best place to work...ever, Im very grateful to be a worker at Uber. I really like the enviroment my co workers are awesome the building is beautiful... Uber has gave me a job that I really enjoy. Im more than glad to be here and I want to stay here for ever., I dont have any complain about Uber. Im really happy to be here its a great job and a great company, 
﻿Driver, For myself Uber has been a pleasant surprise. Before joining Uber I read through a hundred plus reviews and watched a few YouTube related videos(hysterical). I found myself uncertain if I wanted to join the Uber Brigade. The reviews seemed for the most part to be negative. Not enough pay a lot of down time etc. For myself Everytime I flip on the Uber app it's non stop until I stop. However I live in Toronto and I..., All and all I would say it's positive so far except for book keeping and the thought of taxes. Make sure to keep good records your mileage gas etc It is what it is a real life version of the classic arcade game crazy taxi. I'm joking for me it's part time and a perfect fit as I pick my hours., Higher incentives. Optional re-investment into the company with matching contributions. Selling Uber shares to the drivers and giving them incentive to do so with there weekly payouts. Optional tax removal from payout. More information pertaining to end of year personal management of taxes. Perhaps tutorials or links.
﻿driver, work as much as or as little as you want, low pay per mile and low pay per minute - not worth depreciation on car, bring price per mile and minute back up
﻿Uber is a great service but a work in progress., The company offers incentives for drivers and riders. They have tried and continue to strive to alleviate the lack of a job market for many without a college degree., Riders have thought that Uber is a replacement for Taxi's when in actuality its an alternative for those not wanting to buying a car. Another less than desirable is dealing with the insurance company if a passenger breaks something in your car. In my experience it may be better for you to avoid the management team and look for your own solution., UberPool should only be offered at specific times in the day NOT all day and all night. As an example if the buses aren't operating why should I operate my vehicle like a bus. Late at night UberX should be the standard.
﻿Negative outlook for drivers, Flexibility work from home instant pay, Subliminal micromanagement in the form of endless messages and emails no real earning incentives bogus earning guarantees no real driver support or money incentives no matter how long you have been a driver partner. Their bottom line is the most important to them driver rewards or retention does not matter at all even though the driver is the one providing most of the service., No advice to management because they are not interested nor do they care to hear about driver concerns. They never have and they never will.
﻿Uber Delivery, No longer requires delivery drivers to meet a half-dozen metrics in order to qualify for guaranteed hourly bonuses. New bonus structure called "Boost" is similar to rideshare surge pricing except that they're guaranteed during specific hours (lunch & dinner rushes) so now drivers simply earn more when they're willing to work during times of high demand. Other courier services like Postmates expect drivers to meet..., Without Boost earnings vary between $12-15/hr. No vehicle expenses are covered neither are the occasionally unavoidable parking tickets. Delivery only pays base fee + distance so rush hour deliveries can drop to less than one per hour without compensation for the amount of time spent in traffic. Also there's no compensation for time + distance spent reaching the pickup location which is noticeable with Uber Delivery..., Please consider compensation calculations for travel to the pickup location as well as including time for delivery earnings to be included along with distance and base. If Boost ever drops from current levels for peak demand average courier earnings drop well below the minimum wage target after vehicle & transportation expenses and now local business taxes. Squeezing drivers of compensation that is reasonable for...

﻿Uber - Driver, Choose your own hours be able to work when and where you want. Meet new people and possibly include some type of networking ability to further ones self. Being able to market yourself in a way that is professional and personable all while making money., There are several downsides to working at Uber the first being that Uber explicitly states that you should reject any tips. Why should a driver not be able to accept tips it is like a taxi driver not being able to accept tips; preposterous., Lower your cut of the work that I do you do not deserve twenty-five percent of every work that I do maybe fifteen percent but twenty-five is preposterous. Second tips are the right of the worker and not your concern you do not know what is taking place in my car and you should therefore not be aloud to regulate extra-compensatory assets.
﻿Feels like a startup, Ideas pop up every day some amazingly cool and some down to earth you can breathe the enthusiasm and the sense of doing something unique., Ideas pop up every day and it is hard to tell which are going to be still as good as they seem in a year., Laissez faire
﻿Team work makes the dream work!, The work environment is top notch! I think other companies should take note on how Uber treats their employees. All the great treatment does not go unappreciated either! I think it is directly correlated to the strives we have been making. This is my dream job and I could not be more thankful!, I cannot think of any cons right now but if something did come up I would just bring it to management's attention. I have seen things get fixed within hours of a suggestion. Everyone is extremely receptive!, Keep up the great work! I always feel like a valuable member of the team and really I think that is the most important thing to a happy workplace!
﻿Uber not so Super, > working environment > Less Pressure > Free food > Location, > Politics > Biased > No proper evaluation > Infrastructure, 
﻿Working for a pittance, Work when you want... Sometimes the money is good but not consistently., To make a decent paycheck in a suburban area you have to log in 70+ hours just to get by. I don't have time to work-out but ironically sitting all day driving is when I need to the most. Looking at my summary for the week (two days in to the week) I made $115.83 for 16 hrs/23 min. Also this shows that I completed 16 trips according to my count i should be showing 22 trips. I don't have the time to keep up correcting..., Pay your front line (Drivers) more and have minimums in place per hours logged in. Charge more (surge) for trips that take longer to get to which are mostly in the suburban and rural areas. Let the riders tip through the app. Why should I have to lose money on some trips? I should never have to pay that price.

﻿Decent money if you don't mind the hustle., Flexible hours decent cash tips and reasonable response time from customer service should there ever be a problem. Xchange leasing is a great option for those who don't have their own car or any way to get one., The Xchange leasing program is expensive. My car had to be cleaned every day because the level of clients you pick up will become exponentially messier as the day goes on. Uber service fee is ridiculously high and its going up...again. Template responses to most driver issues and it feels as though the company could care less about its "independent contractors." I was also invited to a round table discussion and was..., You take too much of the driver's money and charge way to little to the passenger. There is no tip feature in the app and their should be.
﻿Employees are just a commodity, Uber is seen as an incredibly cool place to work. Compensation package is quite decent. Flex hours (however turning into long hours). Very clever guys around, Employees are treated as a commodity. Too much office politics and if you have bad relationships with local GM you'll be squeezed out in a very dirty way (blocking of corporate account understatement at performance review). Performance reviews are biased and non-transparent., Do not look only on the number of trips. See how some of your local GMs are killing employer brand and do some dirty tricks
﻿CrapJob!!!!!! Horrible as EVER!!!!!!, DON'T DO IT - besides the fact that you get to work whenever you want - the pay is lower than minimum wage - seriously - try it and you'll see how much time you've wasted working for this company. Instead it's better to get a real job and get paid a guaranteed hourly wage instead of this., It's all baloney. Not worth wasing valuable time on this farse., please fire yourselves.
﻿Not worth it, - Very motivated colleagues - Feels like you're doing something important, - Zero work life balance - A lot of internal politics - What you're doing is not really all that important - Ultimately it's just a taxi company, 
﻿Driver, You get to meet a lot good people. You get to hear customers stories and problems. You learn the whereabouts in your area., A lot of miles and wear and tear on your vehicle. Customers are sometimes rude nasty and antisocial. Can be dangerous.,

﻿Good part time Job if unemployed, Set your own hours do it when you want. In my case I am a professional sales person and travel into Chicago proper most days and one the way home after meeting with a few clients I can pickup some rides to off set my fuel bill on they way home. Where I can make 30 - 50 dollars in the 1 - 2 hour drive home., One big one. Not profitable if you live in the remote areas that they service. When I am home and not doing much I will turn the app on and I will get a rider. I will have to drive 10 - 15 miles to the pickup and to find out that they are only doing a mile away so I drive 25 miles round trip for $3.75. I could stay and wait for another rider in the area however that wait might be 3 - 4 hours. Not worth my time. So..., Implement a fee structure when no drivers are available within 15 minutes or 10 miles then a greater far is charged or a minimum far that covers the drive time to the customer’s location. Since we are not provided the end location. To determine of the far is worth the drive.

Does another back round check and fires u for what ever reason they find doesn't even matter if u work with them for a year as a five star driver spend money on a better car and leaving me in debt. They are so quick to discriminate against the driver but not against the Ryders who could very well be a bad person with bad intentions ., Don't give someone hope and the chance to better themselves when u going to be so quick yo take it from them no matter what they have done
﻿Too stressful, -Work on your own time. -24/7, -Constant stress about illegal parking. -Treated poorly by customers. -No comp. for gas., 
﻿Minimum wage job with risk, Work only if you have a cash crunch or leased car and you are under the miles quota. Issues are resolved quickly by partner service. Instant pay, Uber is concerned about riders and itself not the drivers: as driver you assume risk and cost: you have to have a car in fair condition and cell phone with data service at your own expense car insurance. However you are not guaranteed any fares you can be driving for 10 minutes to pick up a passenger and the passenger can cancel before you arrive and you get nothing for your time and effort. Once you arrive and..., Allow drivers to set their own price pick up range and drop off areas. Charge riders for ordering a ride and cancelling driver waiting allow tipping Current fares are too low: taxi from my house to the airport is about $100.00 with Uber about $25.00 so no one will complain if they had to pay $40-$50 Inform the driver how far the ride will be so drivers don't have to drive for 15 minutes to get a $5.00 ride.
﻿Uber Driver, You can drive when you want to. Opportunity to meet nice people. You can make a little bit of money while you're looking for a real job. Improves driving skills and confidence on the road., Uber takes 50 % and more of rider fares (what riders actually pay). You are lucky to make $10.00 an hour (before gas expense). Too much wear on tear on vehicle. Uber doesn't allow riders to tip using credit card (ridiculous) why should they care as it doesn't affect their bottom line and lord knows drivers deserve every penny. The pools are a joke you get an extreme discounted fare and you have to use uber navigation..., Stop being greedy and give drivers more money and allow tipping.
﻿Not very profitable, Fun job met interesting people discovered cool places, Most rides net 2 or 3 dollars. I averaged 10 bucks and hour before expenses., Be truthful about how much drivers really make.

Longer hours are expected and responding to emails after hours happens regularly but if you manage your time wisely you can have a pretty good work life balance. However the overall environment is set up in such a way that it makes it less stressful to work in compared to other companies I've worked for previously., 
﻿Data Analyst, A lot of hustling. truly passionate people who are ready to change the world. free snacks and food., The hours are much longer than any other job I've worked in but this is expected to change as we continue hiring more help, 
﻿ANTI-Driver, You can make your own hours., It's clear that Ubers execs are there to make money only for themselves and not the drivers. Despite being regarded as independent contractors we have no say in setting our rates and are quite literally at their mercy. Because of rate cuts and the over employment of drivers I make 60% less now than I did a year and a half ago. I'll be gone soon., Get more advice from your drivers! They're the backbone of your operation yet I see very little of the concerns being addressed. One recent example is the use of different numbers for every trip. This now means that I must press 4 buttons on my phone just to call my passenger. With the old way I could use hands free to call them. Don't you think this is a little dangerous?
﻿Data Scientist, Great opportunity very interesting work., May be a little bit too competitive., 
﻿Uber review, make your own work schedule able to network the riders usually tend to be much happier with the speedy service, there is not always riders needing to get picked up so you end up wasting fuel. having riders leave behind trash in my vehicle., keep up the hard work. should add a tip charger to the application. i think the drivers would appreciate that greatly
﻿horrible, very energetic fast paced and optimistic colleagues exciting challenging work can be very fun if in the right team, competitive zero-sum mentality unstructured and chaotic internally very stressful no real investment in people many people leave within the first year cut throat political and toxic atmosphere unsustainable business model, actually walk the talk and invest in your people

﻿Great Job If You Don't Need Money, Incredibly Flexible Work Hours You Can Create Your Own Schedule! Meet all kinds of "interesting" people.

This is without accounting for gas insurance maintenance and depreciation., Change the app to allow for tipping. Hire more employee support people.

﻿Looks Good on a Resume, Free lunch Team-oriented environment Great medical and dental benefits Top notch colleagues, Low pay No room for growth Same thing different day, Pay your employees more money Listen to and implement good ideas Promote from within your teams
﻿Exciting company breaking ground fixing hard-problems!, Critically important work to everyone that works/lives in a city all over the world. Uber is really the only company making a dent in solving last-mile transit problems and many other transportation-related issues. Governments want to solve the problems but their vision extends only to their borders; Uber has visibility into the problem domain at the world-level. Come make the world a better place., Despite the fact that we are making the world a better safer place there's a lot of press about the company which isn't entirely positive., The only thing I'd change here is to have some kind of shared goals-dashboard where the priority order of goals for the entire organization is known (success factors would be awesome here.) It would facilitate teams across orgs having more productive planning conversations.
﻿Inspiring and challenging job, The job is very challenging fun interesting and different than anything I have ever experienced before. I love working here and working with very smart and determined individuals. The company is really going places and I am glad I can be a part of it., The job is quite demanding so look for more hours than you are used to unless you do investment banking or busy consulting., Continue to focus on our obsession with helping customers.
﻿Software Engineer, , , 
﻿Started out great..., Initially it was a very relaxed environment yet still professional and productive. Tons of on-going training and incentives to hit metrics. Friendly environment with lots of help when needed. Flexible scheduling and no problem requesting time off., Once the company started growing at a rapid pace the customer service department got the short end of the stick - as it often does. Things got unorganized communication was fuzzy and rare there was less support available and you just kind of felt like you were on your own., Don't pull the rug from under your support department especially when they're the ones who help build this company. Outsourcing is never the answer.

﻿Best place to work, 1. Amazing workplace 2. Encouraging heads 3. Liberty to contribute to strategies and plans 4. Innovative ideas are welcomed 5. Great teams to work 6. Flexible timings, Direct exposure with partners employees must know how to deal with them., Keep up the good work
﻿Do more Get more Be more!, Startup environment helps to develop skills much faster. In Uber you surrounded by top experts from different fields so you can learn from your colleagues. Being part of this team you feel like you are shaping the future. It is the definitely great place to be!, Super dynamic environment constantly keeps you out of comfort zone:) At times if you are moving too fast small mistake leads to the severe consequences but in Uber you are allowed to make a mistake if you able to learn from them., 
﻿Worst "job" ever!, -Make my own schedule that is it, -Depreciation of vehicle -Making less than minimum wage -No benefits, -Start actually listening or get your self driving cars on the roads sooner because its become common knowledge that driving for uber is a scam and makes no money
﻿Uber Partner, Great college job. Working popular bar nights and football games is extremely lucrative if you get good mileage and know when to drive, Uber support is horrid Unruly riders Unpredictable demand/income, Do a better job making your drivers feel appreciated.

﻿Not worth your time, It's nice to work when you want for however long you want and it shows you how much money you make by the trip which is nice, The pay really isn't as good as you hope it will be. You only make decent money during surges and there aren't many, Allow tips. Raise pay.
﻿Stepping stone into the tech world!, First real job I genuinely enjoyed. I remember when I first started I never wanted to leave. I felt the work we were doing was rewarding and innovative. There are free snacks and lunches everyday you have your own desk and most of the managers are always in a good mood. You're extremely motivated to work hard just for the benefit of the company it's almost like a cult. The pay was for me pretty satisfying., It became depressing as an individual committed to the work who was constantly rejected for advancements. I soon found out from a supervisor/mentor that my work was overshadowed by the fact that I didn't have a four year degree. It became hard for me to watch colleagues who put in minimal effort advance over me because they had a 4 year degree from ASU so I decided to take my experience and find a smaller tech company..., Follow the status of your people as well as the status of the work.
﻿Exclusion unless you're ate, casual work atmosphere great technology and lunch. Frankly the lunch is overrated., They treat contract employees like crap. There is a definite division - us vs. them. They don't even invite contractors (who is about 50% of the workforce) to happy hour. How weird is that - - you work side by side with someone and work the same hours and oh by the way you're not invited to have a diet soda or water one afternoon every few weeks with us. Either everyone matters or no one matters - but not in Uber..., 
﻿DO NOT DO IT!!!!!, Not any unless you have your own car and can work seven days a week.you can work when you-want sucks, Not being able to afford lease and you pay 250 a week for the lease to not be your car.that is over a 1000 dollars a month I'm more nroke now then when I started, Xchange leasing and uber are a big joke there taking millions of dollars from America and laughing in our faces.

﻿easy job, driving is easy. Can listen to music at work., Can be dangerous. Not payed alot., Pay more to drivers.
﻿DVO and Loving It, Working for Uber doesn't feel like a "job" but rather a project. The hiring process was streamlined and made sense. The training was fast breathtaking at times. This is the first occupation in my life I am #superpumped to go to!, Sometimes information isn't handed down as well as it could be. However since our department closely resembles a start-up information is often last minute so I get it., Keep up the awesome work!
﻿Pretty good not bad., Sometimes the passengers are rude and not very polite., It would be helpful if we were able to speak to a live person over the phone., 
﻿Worst paid job, Work at your own schedule, Rarely will make over $8.00/Hour. I think is the lowest paid job in the USA. If you are lucky to have a good request in a 25 min / 11.55 mi ride can make up to $14.00 which may sounds good until see deductions going down to $10.80. That does not mean $20.00/Hour because next ride may a be a pool or supermarket one that typically is from $1 to $3 per ride. At the end of three hours may see an income of $30.00 with all...,

﻿No Oversight on Middle Management, Great products; Uber car services UberEats etc. A company bringing convenience and filling a need for society. The ex-team are visionaries and highly skilled and proven innovators., Middle management in the corp offices do not have proper oversight over spending hiring and personnel management and many put into a management role have no experience in managing staff and it propagates because their manager has no experience managing either. HR is basically nonexistent. They really only have Recruiters. Growth and change is too fast and frequent that it's difficult to get stability. There is..., Provide training and oversight of the middle management. Get involved. Don't assume they know what they're doing. Ask why so turn over is high. READ what employee put on their manager's evaluation. Follow up on the input on all the culture surveys.

﻿Eh, Pick and choose when you want to work. Meet a lot of cool people. sometimes you hang with the people you meet., Very low pay. Very high overhead. to many drivers., higher the prices.
﻿Driver, You have total control of your schedule and support staff are kind when you run into a problem. Application process is fast. You can get paid pretty immediately ., The new payout structure including/especially the incentive pay is deceptive. The uber percentage of your total keeps increasing and doing the final math does not look good when you factor in taxes that have not yet been paid out gas and wear and tear on your car., In order to keep drivers happy and willing to work with a company that does not encourage tipping to its customers the pay structure needs to be changed back to previous models.
﻿Amazing Ride in a Rocket Ship, - Super fast ride in one of the finest company of its era - Very smart people who are really passionate about things they are doing - Lot of autonomy to local teams/regions- Not typical HQ driven company - Amazing onboarding program called Uberversity where all nubers from Globe come and participate at HQ (SFO), - Not much induction you are Sea literally in first few weeks - Older Uber folks generally don't think person need time to adjust and things come at you very fast, - Great company keep it going. Focus on better and structured induction. May be have a buddy system for first couple of months
﻿Driver, Make your own schedule income is all base on work you put in., You can meet a rude customer or drunk., Make each paystub printable like you do your 1099 tax forms.
﻿Operation Coordinator, People here always be hustling!, Work/Life Balance should be improved., Overall is good.
﻿UBER in Roanoke, Set your own hours. Do things at your own pace. Never have to worry about running out of sick time or unapproved vacation. Pays pretty well for the actual amount of time spent driving passengers. Growing company available and hiring almost everywhere. Great as a part time job only if you have a vehicle that already qualifies., Many many drivers on the road not enough riders to go around in some areas. Lots and lots of down time. Also: Do not recommend purchasing a new(er) car for UBER unless you desperately need it for other uses as well. Do not quit your day job and try to do this full time. Be wary asking UBER drivers in your area about their job/earnings - they may be trying to entice you so they can get the referral!, No way to distance or see nearby drivers from the partner app need to pull up the rider app to make sure you're in a decent spot by yourself. Wish referrals were discouraged once a city has a certain driver/rider ratio or a minimum guaranteed pay per hour if online consistently with a certain number of rides within an allotted time. (example:1 per hour)
﻿Driver, -Choose your own hours -People are generally kind -The pay is solid, -Sometimes you have to deal with unkind people -You have to handle your own taxes -Car maintenance is sometimes brutal, I don't believe that I really have any advice. The purpose of Uber is to generate as much money as possible so cutting driver rates is advantageous to them. Can't knock them for that.
﻿A complete mess, Experience in a tech start-up Bragging rights, Management seems to care very little about the workers Policies that are not customer focused Lack of stability, Offer incentives to contracted employees to keep them with the company.
﻿Uber Driver, Pick your own hours get to meet lots of interesting people, Uber pays its driver lousy! After allyour expenses you make between minimum wage and $10.00 per hour. Might as well go work at Walmart's and not put excessive miles on your car. Plus Uber does not have a tipping function in the app. Riders are too cheap to tip even though an Uber ride costs about 1/3 of that of a taxi driver!, Raise your fares so drivers can make a decent wage after all expenses. Add tipping option to rider app. Do an initial public offering (IPO) and join the real world of an ongoing enterprise. Stop hemorrhaging cash and get your costs under control and raise prices like a normal corporation would do to stay in business. Stop wasting new capital infusions which do no good for investors. Funding negative cash flow through...
﻿Great for college students, You'all earn more than minimum wage You can work anytime you want Once you figure out when and where to drive you really can make about 18 an hour. That is what j average in Chicago, It can be hard to get a hold of corporate. Include a call center instead of everything being over email, Get a call center in order for drivers to be able to call you. Also show us ratings of clients. Sometimes that part does not work
﻿Driver/Partner, Great way to make extra money. I had to get a car I bought new If I make $450 a month my car payments are paid for., I don't know in advance where the customer is going. Some rides take me to S Miami when I live near Boca and I can not pick up rides going back. During rush hour that is 2-3 hours of time wasted where as if I stay in my area I can get continuous work., Allow Drivers to know the intended rout of the rider.
﻿Uber is SuperFUN, Personally I don't and can't disclose where I'm currently working. :( And I can't join contests of Uber such as the Grammy's UberDUET (even though I don't sing.) etc., Stay as you are. Most of you are surely someone to look up to., 
﻿Probably not worth it - but maybe, You work only when you want. It is by far the largest network of Riders so you generally don’t have to wait too long for a call. Easy job to get., NO TIPPING! This would be the easiest thing in the world for Uber to correct. It costs them nothing to allow for tipping through the app (like Lyft does) but they refuse. Says a lot about how they truly feel about their “Uber Partners” that they won’t do a simple thing like that and make the lives of their employees better. Company makes NO attempt to help out with learning the ropes maintaining a consistent income..., Allow Riders to tip Drivers through the app. It cost virtually nothing and most Riders want that option and it could make a world of a difference to the Drivers. Have a better system for bringing in new drivers put them with experienced drivers so that they can hit the ground running and have someone to call with basic questions. Work on Customer Service for both Riders and Drivers - any kind of improvement there could...
﻿Great Place to work but feel let out, Free food everyday fast paced goal driven environment and lots of hours to be worked., Feel not part of the team and very dispensable since you are a contractor. Feels like you are always working even when at home constant stress., Include the whole team in events meetings and also communicate with everyone. Don't always make it feel as if one person is better than the other and give credit where credit is due.
﻿Buggy program with virtually no support. Pun intended., You can work when you want but dont expect to make anything over minimum wage once taxes and wear and tear on your car is figured in., No immediate support for the driver or the rider. If you make a mistake your dealing with an application that doesnt allow you to fix mistakes. Very poor functionality in the design of the app. When the app boggs down you may unintentionally drop off riders in the app but not from the ride. Thats only one of many simple issues that design of the interactive screen could be deaigned to keep from happening. But their help..., App doesnt have very good tracking. Many accepted rides dissappear without a trace. Mysterious rides are acceptted then cancelled without any notice given by the app or interaction from the driver. Sad you got a great idea but don't seem to be very good at dealing with drivers or customers. Need a fast response hotline for quick questions or issues. Majority of Help topics are nonsense. Needed topics nonexistent....
﻿Its okay if you need spare cash, , , 
﻿It's great to work in my spare time, I work in my free time Organize your time do you know people, Is invested a lot in gasoline there are lost almost 50% of the profits, VERY HAPPY
﻿Driver, flex hours meeting public good online support, low pay not personal cannot set parameters for trips that are offered, have an option so that the driver can receive certain requests (towards home at end of day ...)
﻿Exciting work amazing colleagues, Exciting work incredible feedback loop to see the value of work colleagues are very smart and a pleasure to work with tremendous opportunities to learn on the job, Long hours can sometimes be a chaotic work environment, Make sure to actively stamp out any moves to become a more political organization
﻿CUSTOMER SERVICE, Yr able to meet all kinds of people from all walks of life., Customer Service your not able to pickup the phone and talk to someone. Everytime Ive asked a question about anything to do with UBER all I ever got was someone from outside the USA that doesnt have a clue to what your asking them. Your NOT ABLE to speak with someone from upper management to help with your problems, Be available to us so if the so called customer service rep cant fix or help us. Maybe you might be able too.
﻿Uber misconception, Set your own hours. No boss. Totally freedom to ride. Ability to work as long as you like. Drive your own car., Not enough compensation. Inaccurate surge information. Not including vehicles that clearly are upscale. Limiting certain Uber levels to particular areas of the city., And tip option to app. Higher base pay
﻿meh, app glitches are a problem a lot., fix bugs get rid of auto-pool uber navigation requirement, 
﻿OH NO UBER !!!, Absolutely loved driving for the public and most of my customers enjoyed riding with me. Great conversations learned new places in the city. Weekly pay. Largest tip I received was $50. It was a great night!, Hated the way Uber managed and treated the drivers. They would cut the fares then make up diverse conditions/qualifications to meet up with the shortages. If you could not meet the conditions you would not get the pay. Some days I could feel the greed coming from the company. Very little human contact with company (no phone number to call for information). Then it was also easy to tell that they really didn't read the..., Get a job with another company. Your soul is priceless...
﻿Software Engineer I, Uber is a fast-paced and innovative company with some of the best engineering talent in the industry. The work you do here affects millions of people worldwide and it really shows in the awareness developers bring to scale. The people here are always willing to help and provide advice whenever its necessary and there is a large variety of engineering electives offered frequently throughout the week. I would recommend..., The fast-moving attitude creates a fairly intense culture and that might scare some people away, None - everything is going great!
﻿Challenging and Impacting Work, Uber hires get to start contributing from day 1. We work with some of the smartest people in the world. Teams stay relatively small to move fast. Open culture where the best idea wins., Long hours but were disrupting the way the world moves people around. It's going to take a massive effort., Keep training up and coming management to enable leadership for incoming new grad talent leading to more growth and promotion.
﻿Driver, The conversations between you and the driver never cease to entertain and constantly create learning opportunities and networking possibilities. I enjoy driving so this job is nice. Plus the flexibility is bar-none., Late nights can be difficult when driving someone who has had too much to drink. However it is better that they are not driving home themselves! Also the driver is hung out to dry whenever there is a technology issue or the passenger makes a user-mistake in describing their location., Keep up the good work and continue to be accessible whenever a conflict or issue arises. The flexibility of the whole model is what makes this so brilliant. I use Uber as a passenger and it works very well both ways.

﻿Driver, Great wages in core La. create your schedule., People can be disrespectful of your car., None
﻿Finance specialist for Xchange Leasing, Management is amazing. They really want you to succeed. Your input is truly valued., It's a start up so some of the processes are cumbersome. With that in mind you also have the ability to work with your team to make it better!, 
﻿Best Place to do your best work!, An intense pace with an intense focus on doing your best work. Working here I'm learning at 5x the pace of any other job I've ever had. Love being able to work closely with people outside of my org to solve problems. Love the openness leadership has about our direction and willingness to answer tough questions., Nothing to complain about at this point!, Keep on doing what you are doing.
﻿I wake up looking forward to work, + Not a single slacker on my team. I work with helpful creative and smart people. + We're making a material difference in the real world with the technology we are building. + Our US benefits packaging is incredible especially for women and families. + It still early. The company has grown like crazy but it still feels like a start up. + We take feedback seriously and are always using it to get better. + Inspirational..., - There aren't a lot of boundaries as far as work/life; e.g. non-urgent requests come through at odd hours and on weekends. - Unlimited vacation can have the opposite effect when managers and leaders don't model that it's OK to take time off. On the flip side I see many new dads taking extended parental leave which is awesome. - I'm not a big fan of the performance review process that leans heavily on subjective feedback...., Would be great to see more transparency and objective measures in the performance review process. As great as it is to produce results and hustle hard its really important for team members to have a path for growth so we're not looking externally to make next steps.
﻿Uber Brand Ambassador, The pros are that I can work anytime I want. There are also different events scheduled year round to earn extra cash., The con are that the communication throughout the chain of commands wasn't always the best. The managers over me were usually working from a different location so I never met them face to face., 
﻿Driver, Can work whenever you want., Can be difficult to motivate yourself to work during the busy hours of weekends and holidays. Pay is declining as ride sharing market becomes more compeptitve, pay drivers more provide better driver support.
﻿Quick Cash, Easy way to make quick money, No benefits for working no predictable income, 
﻿Listen to your drivers, Able to work on my own time able to stop working when I want frees me up to run the errands I need to when I need to and to make a little bit of extra spending money, Uber calls drivers "partners" but never really listens to what we have to say or suggest. They also need to update their rating system for drivers., Listen to your drivers; some of us are willing to pay for our own background checks in the states that are trying to require them.
﻿High school run by the students..., - Solid perks: Uber credits unlimited snacks breakfast food lunches dinner after 8pm gym credit good benefits unlimited vacation policy - You end up being pretty good friends with most of your colleagues - No dress code - Luxurious facilities, **Disclaimer to those who are reading Glassdoor reviews about uber: most positive reviews are left by employees who have been at company < 3 months. When you are a new employee or a "nUber" as they call you you are incessantly emailed by the HR COO etc. to leave a positive review on Glassdoor. Amazingly after 3 months at the company the review requests suddenly dissipate. They know that after a while employees get..., I am inspired by the hires of Kellyn Kenny and Jeff Jones at the executive levels. The test will be if Travis actually allows them to institute real change and let the company mature into a viable well run business.
﻿Uber Partner, Flexibility work the hours you want to meet very interesting people better your customer service skills and the opportunity to make very good money., Uber doesn't provide any benefits have to use my personal car. depreciation of using on vehicle and all maintenance comes out of my own pocket. Uber market is getting saturated with drivers and there's days where you make very little money., Limit cancellations and if the driver gets close to destination and rider cancel give them a minimum charge. Have been told by several riders that they've been picked up in substandard cars. Drivers should personally drive to an Uber Hub and have car inspected.
﻿Past Worker Bee, , , 
﻿Sr. Manager, Employe benefits Paid but cheap food Gas Card, Long Routes and Management is not that great, 
﻿Community Operations Associate, The company is full of elite people and it's definitely somewhere you get the chance to bring real impacts., You will be dealing with ambiguity A LOT. So if you are not comfortable with ambiguity I don't suggest you to work here at all., Please recruit someone who actually care about individual's development instead of just focusing team's KPIs.

﻿driver, meet interesting people but alot of drunks, u dont get paid as good as they say !!!, 
﻿It is what you make of it..., Easy money. Set own hours. Instant payment option is excellent. Flexible car use options and outlets to get a car., No riders in Austin. So many different web pages to access with information (Ubereats Austin Uber specific Uber driver blogs driver site) and it can be overwhelming. Local office not open on weekends which is odd especially since the Austin market is food delivery only., Support center in Austin needs to be open during hours more fitting to the delivery service peak times since that's all we do in Austin.
﻿Driving for Uber for 1 1/2 years, Freedom to set own hours meet great people great pay, Pickup location often in accurate need a better check and balance to weed out bad drivers. Should allow riders the option to request favorite driver if available., 
﻿Fun for part time, Clients are a blast most of the time meeting new people, pay was low Hours were long, 
﻿uber, uber is great because you get money fast and on your own schedule. I advise everyone to go and work for uber., Unlike any job there are cons. Before signing up for uber you MUST go through the ful TLC licensing process which can cost up to $1000 USD, The best advice I can give the management at Uber is that yall should really be more proactive with your drivers.

﻿The most inspiring people to work with, Great team of people aspiring to achieve common goal to make transportation reliable as running water. I have never seen people within the company to be so connected and collaborative. Each of them is a high skilled special individual respecting his own and company culture and values. The problems which you tackle every day are so complex that skills you gain are transferable in any field., It's a pity that I didn't join Uber sooner :) In work-life balance is a room for improvement for sure..., 
﻿Driver, Great extra income and awesome flexibility, Can be slow at times but durable, 
﻿Disorder chaos awful operations management, The engineers are brilliant. Everyone on the tech side is great to work with. The product is exceptional. It's fun to perform research on a product that's going to be a part of everyday life someday. The company provides generous food and travel accommodations. I love the company's mission. The founders are very inspirational., Management is pathetic. Those on the management side lack the experience and education necessary to deliver on company goals! This company is at the forefront of cutting edge technology but this technology will never make it to market with inexperienced improperly educated lazy irresponsible hippie management like we have now., Upper management and investors need to step in and replace mis-hires on the management side. The company is financially very irresponsible and wasting enormous amounts of money due to failures made by a management team of waste fellows. We need management that obtained MBAs from top-tier schools and have proven themselves in previous roles at top companies. We are experiencing the typical tech startup problems; we need...
﻿I don't feel like a partner!, You can work when you want to and you don't have to worry about a overbearing person watching your every move and ever break., However there is no contact number to call a person in charge when you have questions and you have to drive to a hub for answers. It also put a Tremendous strain on your car. have a good mechanic on hand and don't try to get a car through them either it will cost you less to buy it your self out of pocket cause they want weekly payments instead of monthly payment., get a contact number and fix the payments that people pay through your system. Your suppose to strike deals with the dealerships make them rich. I would like more of my money to go in my pocket than to have it go to another bill.
﻿Good experience, - Very Good salary - Autonomy - Working in a disruptive environment - International context - Creative environment - Shares - Health insurance compensation - Perks - uber credits, - High engagement/involvement - long hours - issues to manage during weekends holidays... - Uber working style - No bonus pretty low - Fierceness king of the world,

﻿Partner Driver, , , 
﻿Driver, Been driving 3 years. It's a love hate thing. I like the bonus structure I'm on at the moment. If it's long term it would would rock, Drivers are pawns. Itso hard to tell when things will change,

﻿Uber, Challenging work among the best people, long work hours like any other startup nothing bad in particular, none
﻿Driver, Meeting people and learning the DMV routes, Traffic and parking when picking up deliveries, Parking passes
﻿My experience with Uber, The hours are 100% flexible. The work is easy., Uber does nothing to encourage tips. I never received a single tip. Often you will be sent several miles away for a tiny fair. When the app screws up or the customers misuse the app uber does nothing to compensate. Their support is fast but horrible. Nearly always you get someone who can not form a coherent sentence and who fails to comprehend the nature of the query. I was notified that my customer ratings were too..., Show a little appreciation for your drivers. There is no reason why you can't integrate tipping within the rider app instead of all but discouraging tipping. Taxiing is a personal service and the pay does not fairly compensate the drivers' work. Usually a taxi drivers' wage is supplemented by the fact that a majority of riders understand this and therefore tip. I understand that the technology is new but when your...
﻿Great perks and a lot of hustle, Amazing perks and co-workers. Great benefits package., Lack of efficiency in certain areas -- it seems like we're constantly taking a few steps back. Career paths can often times be a mystery depending on what org you're in for better and for worse., Try to retain your good employees.
﻿Cheaters and Liars, Met some great people that rode with me. Was happy to be able to help people get where they needed to go safely., Worked really hard and had to really step outside my comfort zone as a 58 year old mother and grandmother to do this job. Hit my 50th ride and was super excited to get my bonus (which the Uber app kept reminding me was only "so many rides away"). When I did hit it I find out (to make great disappointment) that they gave $100 to my referee but said my area was not eligible for an invitee bonus!!! Then they send me an..., Don't LIE AND CHEAT good people out of their money.
﻿Uber Movement, Uber is growing at a pace that allows you to have a direct impact on where the company is going. One of the cultural values "Let Builders Build' is incorporated in the day to day and really makes this company an exciting place to be as you work on solving some really hard problems., It's still in start up mode which requires a lot of time investment from many teams., If you work hard and can deal with consistent change Uber is a great place to work but if you want an easy job this isn't the company for you.
﻿Big scam, None worth to work for them, Just making money for uber using your car and exchanging the value if you car to fiew$., 
﻿Uber driver, Alright sometimes including the flexibility, It takes a toll on your car, Raise the rates and add tip option punks
﻿Uber Driver, You get paid weekly and in a timely fashion. All moneys earned for the week got directly into your account. To get started all you need is an active smartphone a valid drivers license insurance and registration. A copy of your inspection is needed but not required. You upload all of your info from your phone and are notified after a few days if you're eligble to start., Not knowing who you may be picking up and what they're motivate is is always a tense situation. So far all of my pickup's have either been college students or people traveling to and from work., Have it so that the driver can see who they're picking up. Some drivers may only feel comfortable driving a certain sex and would feel safer if they could get a quick look see at what their potential passenger may look like. Not only for that reason but for pick up purposes as well. I have waited at a college for almost 30 minutes because I had no idea which way they may have been coming from or what they looked like....
﻿Uber Black, The clients that can afford the upgrade limousine Black/Lux Car service which is expensive make for a pleasant work experience. In doing this job for over 2+years I can count the problems on two hands with thousands of clients. Customers were generally upscale corporate and intelligent. It is a fun position. My private business was all the same nice no complaints., Working for Uber Technologies at its best was not a good experience. This is a large company that presents itself as a technology company. This is a company that has no telephone number (everything is done via email or in person). In person means you drive to the local office pick a number and wait in a room to be called. This experience is similar to going to the state office for your drivers license. This staffed..., None they know exactly what they are doing
﻿Terrible technical support for drivers, Work your own schedule If you enjoy driving and meeting people like I do it's fun Good for part-time extra cash, Their technical support is non-existent. If you have a problem with the app you're on your own. There is a help desk but the people just cut-and-paste the in-app help screens. They have yet to solve a problem for me. Strictly supplemental can't make a living at it at least in my city., Don't waste my time and insult my intelligence with fake technical support.
﻿Uber, Thats the future. You can do your job when you like., Cant say nothing bad. I was happy white it and live it. Its a big fun., Keep on boys. Thats the way. You are the best
﻿Product Engineering Intern - Philippines, The Uber Team in Manila is very tightly knit. Altogether the full time employees work coherently to provide interns with a motivating and empowering environment to work in. Your managers at Uber want you to succeed as an intern and they give you all the tools that you need to do so., I thought that the compensation to interns could have been increased. However you do receive wonderful experiences while working at Uber., Management is doing really well with their internship program in the Philippines. They should strive to keep the quality of the program up to standard for the next following years.
﻿Moving fast but risky, Great people with awesome backgrounds and knowledge People are helpful and want to move fast, Give time for the infrastructure to grow and stabilize Long working hours and no work/life balance Long working hours, Hire more people and improve the perks also do something about the stress level
﻿Best place to work!, People! Driven open-minded crazy! It's so nice to work withe them all! It truly couldn't be better. Besides that: opportunities to grow great management all benefits which come with the job - multisport luxmed snacks great biuro etc., Honestly? I'm not sure if I see any right now. Maybe they come with time. Of course there are some stressful days but I can always count on my awesome coworkers to help me., Great job! We're getting bigger and better with every second. I want to see where we can go next and what the company can evolve into.
﻿After cost of Gas Insurances Depreciation Maintenance Taxes Cell phone data you be luck if u make any profit., Sometimes you meet nice people. You get familiar with the city & every pothole. Network pass along your business cards., Uber collect data from your phone 24/7/365 so u are also use as pig in experiment. It drains battery like crazy., 
﻿OK place to work, Great intelligent people. Passionate about their work. Many passionate about product and where we're headed. Some decent perks for the tech world., More equity based than cash. Work life balance can be tough. Fast growth means a lot of growing pains -- not all the leaders are as mature., Stronger focus on work life balance
﻿transportation, I enjoyed the freedom of making my own hours. I love to drive listen to music and meeting new people., After driving the pay decreased significantly within 1-2 months!, Increase pay rate!
﻿Uber, Energetic and happening work environment, Poor career growth at times, Focus on employees long term career growth prospects. RSUs aren't as valuable when no IPO in sight
﻿Geo Mapping and the Urban Grind, A great job if you like driving and exploring a city. Uber had a great team of directors and technicians., Long hours sitting in car driving  make sure you stretch and take short breaks to decompress the spinal area., Nothing at this time
﻿Just don't. You will regret your time here., - Passionate employees - Working with people across the globe and in nearly every country leads to vastly different and interesting perspectives - Genuinely interesting problems to solve - Well known and awesome products - Prime office locations for SF, - Absolutely no work-life balance. Do you value your time outside of work? Then don't work here. They literally tell you "this is not a 9-5 job this is a lifestyle." - Also don't work here if you: have kids are a woman are a minority or have opinions that conflict with upper management. - Overall the company is poorly managed. Uber is filled with former consultants who have never worked long-term for previous..., Treat your employees like people diversify your middle management and stop requiring employees to always be available.
﻿Simple Review, Pick Your Own Days and Hours You Work, Pay used to be good until they cut the rates, 
﻿Solid Flexible work, Decent earnings nothing special. Flexibility is great although tough to find work in off-peak hours. Nice to be able to work when you want and get some good exercie., Not amazing pay. Biking in downtown Toronto can be pretty sketchy and downright miserable on a cold or rainy day. Often times can be hard to get jobs., Increase the profit sharing margin and ramp up the guarantee incentives. Promote usage in off-peak hours to allow for a more even order distribution.
﻿A means to an end, The best thing about Uber is its flexibility. You can log on whenever work whenever take as many breaks as you want take as long of a vacation. This is a great job for college students/graduate students to help make ends meet as it definitely helped me achieve my degree., There are a lot of cons. First the maintenance towards your vehicle is your own cost. They only pay you for miles driven as standardized for tax exemptions (in FL atleast).

﻿Great and team and meaningful real-world problems, - Surrounded by competent engineers who not only share technical insights but also life advice. - Task-oriented culture; finish your work and don't stay overnight. (At least in my team). - The idea that the company is solving a meaningful problem is very genuinely motivating. - World-class engineering infrastructure and fun environment., I have not experienced negativity so far., Keep hiring competent people
﻿Software Engineer II, Still has a feel of a growing company within. A lot of young and energetic people., You want to stay late yourself and it's very easy to do so. Dinner (+beer) is served towels/showers in the building., 
﻿Best and worst company, Make as much money as you want and work when you want., The longer you work for them the lower the rates. It seems like the longer you work for them the worst you get treated., 
﻿This company is TERRIBLE!!!, It allows flexibility while you look for a real job. That's really the only pro I have and I've been driving off and on for over a year., Horrid driver support and customer service. Cookie cutter responses unorganized impersonal and doesn't care about its partners. Don't be fooled EVERYONE is expendable!, By trying to save a penny on your financial statement you're costing yourself more money in the long run because you are aggravating riders and drivers with your current customer service scheme. The only way anyone can contact Uber is by email to an outsourced company overseas who only replies back with canned email responses that don't address the issue 75% of the time (and I'm being nice with the percentage). This...
﻿Great for the amount of effort required, Flexible hours ability to work only peak times or whenever you want. In a decent size population area there's always ride to be given you just need to find a pattern or location that works for that time of the day. You meet a ton of interesting amazing people. I think that #1 the pay is amazing for the work required. #2 The variety and variance in riders is amazing and keeps the job interesting regardless of how..., Never know what to expect. 99% of the riders are super nice and wonderful 1% are entitled jerks. That's life though., Once you're done pouring money into expansion it would be great to see a few more driver perks like a car maintenance allowance after 6 months larger discount on fuel card etc.
﻿HR Recruiting Intern, Nice office environment. Nice people to work with., Very limited systematic training for interns., 
﻿Uber Rip off, Set your own hours weekly pay no boss you can reject undesirable passengers. Choose neighborhoods you want to work in., The company lowers it's prices and increases it's own commission thus screwing over drivers passengers very rarely tip Uber conditioned them not to more often than not you lose money (and time)rather than make a profit Oversaturated with driver's competing for the lousy $2.40 ride., Uber has always been cheaper and better than taxis it's pointless to lower prices lower prices attracts undesirable cheap passenger's which find ways of cheating like having multiple accounts or requesting outside surge areas and then calling with the real address. Please add a tip option( if prices were higher tips wouldn't be a big deal). Uber assist should pay more to drivers in the form of Uber taking a smaller cut...
﻿Awesone Brand, Great people. Cool Brand. Global Reach., Intense culture. No career growth., 
﻿Good place to work, The environment is friendly and the organization culture is great for a beginner. The pay is above average even for an executive position.The executives also have relevant authority to make decisions with regards to the given situations. Great support from other employees. A great platform not only to work but to learn too., Even the management has less powers to get some work done. (Ex: Setting up a new office), Organization should be giving the country's management relevant authority to go ahead with big decisions as above. Plus the employees should be given training on soft skills which will improve the work quality and the personal development of the employee as well.
﻿Like Uber wish there was more constructive job growth, I've been at Uber for over 2 years now I definitely love the environment and feel like I work on meaningful impactful projects. I'm also surrounded by some of the smartest people I've interacted with and am constantly inspired by them every day., I dislike that most of my career moves over the last 2 years have been lateral. I also find myself torn between making a decision that the data supports versus making a decision that feels right (e.g. price cuts). Overall I feel confident in what we do I just wish we put more heart and empathy into it., More constructive coaching - direct reports should be working towards career goals and set up to succeed.

﻿Driver, Flexible schedule. It is nice to be able to drive anytime and anywhere you'd like., There is no set salary so it is difficult to plan for things financially, Offer minimum pay if a certain amount of hours are logged.
﻿Uber Partner, Easy to start. Simply provide them with license and a safety on your vehicle, Does not pay enough to make it worth your effort. Driver Rating system is unrealistic., Pay more and reduce the minimum rating of Drivers.

Sometimes I have to hop on my computer in the evenings and on the weekends but I can do that from home., Keep up the great work. Just try to balance workload among employees a little bit better.

﻿Low Payment, Uber takes out a large amount of what the driver get paid and doesn't pay for dead miles while online and doesn't push for customer tips uber is like being a waitress but on the road people don't realize tips help us more than they think if it's too good to be true and the ride is cheap what makes you think the drivers are getting paid good ?, Pay driver a 5$ minimum for short distances instead of 2-3$ and encourage tips Because by the time we finished working and driving all these different places our check goes right to Chevron and Shell gas stations out of the driver pockets,

In certain areas you can do ok but it's still costly when it comes to expenses., I have no advice to management. None that they would listen to most likely. Congratulations on such a successful company though.
﻿Awesome company with insanely great values-that are actually put into action, I have gotten the opportunity to make real world impact. I like that about Uber. Most companies are worried about the next social opportunity but here at Uber we are helping shape the future., In some parts of the company people feel pressured to work extremely long hours and I even feel that pressure sometimes. I think this happens because there is pressure put on by management or senior engineers to get things done because everything is "critical". My team does a pretty good job of this and I feel like I have a great work/life balance though., Sometimes personal feelings get in the way of being logical about who is doing a great job. This shows in performance reviews-when the brightest and best engineers on the team don't get great reviews I wonder what is going on. Aside from that I think you are doing a fantastic job you are some of the smartest people I've gotten the opportunity to work with.

﻿Driver, Flexible hours can work long hours if desired., In San Antonio the rates are very low. We make $2.62 on minimum fare rides. While Uber takes $2.58. They aren't very different in most cities. This is totally disproportionate. Also they take your money sometimes without giving notice at all. They call it adjusting fares and never explain why. The app often doesn't work properly for drivers or riders. Uber is a shady greedy company but I guess it's better than working..., Higher rates better compensation for drivers. Rates right now are literally less than half the cost of a taxi in many cities like mine and we provide better service in every way. Rates could be higher. People want to be treated like kings and queens even if they are paying $1 for my services we deserve better compensation. An option to tip also instead of lying to people about how it's included.

﻿Decent job. Flexible hours, Work on your own schedule. Freedom to pursue other career options while still making money. Easy to get started. You can complete an application and start working within 4 business days. While driving for Uber you are insured under their policy., Not the highest paying job. Can be taxing on your vehicle. No job safety. No benefits.,

Sometimes promotions in bad areas., Let brand ambassador team leaders choose locations or at least hear what they have to say about why a location may not be good for certain promotions.,

﻿An inspiring fast-paced dynamic company to work at!, You are constantly surrounded by intelligent driven straight-talking yet lovely and highly-motivated people that will challenge you everyday to do better. It can get overwhelming at times but instead of feeling drained you are actually more inspired to go in everyday and level up., As with most fast growing companies it can get a little messy. Processes are still being set and updated. But if you are quick on your feet constantly communicating with people and open to changes you'll do fine., Keep an eye on the basics - career opportunity culture morale HR PR. Numbers are important but so is service product experience hearing from the little guys and branding. Both externally and internally.
﻿Shady practices, Working for Uber allows partner drivers to choose and work the hours they prefer. Cool customers 97% of the time., Wear and tear on vehicle. Allowing clients to access car radio through your app (and possibly data plan) which opens a backdoor for hacking your phone and car's computer system. Compensation not great; Pay is a lot less than advertised. -Too much down time between trips which you are not paid for. In order to make an adequate day rate you have to spend 12+ hours in the car. Not compensated for time and distance required..., Stop being shady and dirty.

﻿Horrible company, Get to meet people and explore the city and surrounding areas. Very flexible work schedule come and go as you please work any hours you want., Pay is very very low after maintenance and wear and tear on your car. Uber support doesn't help its drivers properly bans them from driving for missing proof of inspection for NC plated vehicles when they do not require proof of inspection for NC plated vehicles - then takes forever to correct the issue then doesn't correct the issue properly resulting in a lost wages., Revert fares and rates back to what they were in beginning of 2015. Support your drivers properly so they can work and earn money stop telling NC drivers that Uber doesn't require proof of inspection for NC plated vehicles then don't allow them to go online in the uber partner app because of missing or expired proof of inspection for their NC plated vehicle.
﻿Great enviorment, You get to work for a progressive company with lots of positive co-workers., I have not seen any cons so far but I am very new. So far so good., 
﻿bad at time of holidays, It is good if you do it between 6 to 9 but difficult to get the deliveries at that time as well sometimes it is flexible as students working part time can earn some money, very low minimum wage not good working environment bad working environment no contact support so many riders, divide deliveries equally to people and have a contact suport for the riders to contact otherwise it gets very difficult for rider if receiver of the order ddn't turn up or something else

﻿CSR, Free lunch great colleagues and central location., Long hours and not much downtime. Management have favourites and there is not much transparency in the company., 
﻿Great Company, Great place to work with very smart people and always changing environment, No work life balance which makes in challenging in the long term., 
﻿Pay is only decent (above minimum wage) with surge and incentives., You only work when you choose to. Huge huge perk!, Driving without surge or incentive guarantees means making well under minimum wage when gas and car wear are factored in. Incentives in Atlanta are broken. You must accept 70% of rides but you also must pick up 70% of clients within a specified area. This means you must "hide" when outside of the specified area by going offline or going to a slow zone after dropping off passengers outside of the area., Atlanta - Take another look at the incentive qualifiers. Do you really want to punish drivers for being honest and accepting riders from whatever area they are in? The current system forces drivers to cheat or hide for fear of being disqualified because clients outside of the area desire rides.
﻿Marketing Manager, Forget about personal time or life. Everything in your life becomes about Uber., Better track your GMs in terms of employment conditions, 
﻿Just a joke not really another word for it, Ability to work your own hours on your own schedule weekly pay - paid out regularly in my experience. It's a 24/7 industry (though is very very slow during night hours), Uber will constantly and deviously skim of your earnings until your ability to make anything close to minimum wage will need 60 plus hours per week, Stop the skimming (in particular UberPOOL) where you make more than the drivers get support based in the states not Indonesia and allow tips - it's not a bad business model it's a service standard that Lyft has proved over and over works well and keeps moral up!!
﻿assistant engineer, , , 
﻿Poor customer service, Meet new people  control of your time, It seems like when you go to the green hub center for your concerns or help they are clueless. When they decide to finally give full attention to your concern it's all about the rider verse you as a driver. Unbelievable! Doesn't matter if you have a 4.9 rating they still don't care. Can't reimburse me my $10.00 they owe me! Ugh, Care about your driver like you care about the rider rating. Thanks
﻿Driver Review, Flexibility Surge pricing allows for higher earnings Driver benefit program includes but not limited to: auto repair/maintenance discounts cell phone discounts gas discounts referral bonus, Seemingly the biggest "issue" is with surge pricing. Surge pricing itself is a pro---however you have to be logged into the app to determine if prices are surging. (there is a notification available to inform when prices are surging- I have yet to receive a notification), As a part-time driver my advice is to create/update notifications that allow drivers to be notified when and where the surge. (possibly the amount of the surge in given location)
﻿Uber is beneficial but limiting, Work when you can flexible hours pay isn't too bad as long as you drive enough during each week to make up for gas car payment and extras. I live in texas so about 280-400 a week is good enough to stay a float and have a little extra cash. if you have more time then you can make 500+ but that's a lot of driving, Some rides cancel or put in the wrong address uber is notorious with tips ratings from riders can be devastatingly harsh but it doesn't happen too often so just keep brushing it off and you'll be fine. some rude passengers who try to drink and smoke in your car. THEY DONT WITHHOLD TAXES SO KEEP ALL RECEIPTS OF CAR MAINTENANCE GAS MILEAGE INSURANCE CAR PAYMENT AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU DID WITH IT FOR WORK. Also..., listen to drivers when they email you about drivers saftey and previous riders. Please add a feature to uber where riders can tip drivers. and if ratings dip too low contact the driver and get the story behind it. it would be nice if uber would compensate for gas or some maintenance for the drivers.
﻿TNC Independent contractor driver, Flexible call your hours. Only highly profitable hours are around special events drinking holidays. etc. when folks need a designated driver. Way early morning airport rides and late night bar rides home are profitable but at a time when we too would rather be in bed!, Standard passenger rates are ridiculously low not enough to cover operating your vehicle or make any actual profit especially during slow periods. Summer doldrums in my area are especially difficult to earn any significant amount other than paying the car expenses. 10 mile 30 minute rides sometime only netting $3-$5.00 then 0 deadheading home frustrated and calling it a day., Stop the price war! You have plateaued. Cab rates are set and not ever to be as low...Uber will never eliminate cabs in the near future so the rates should be more in line with them as Uber is still 2 to 1 preferred mode of car service over Cabs. Even a 2x-3x surge rate in my area is still less than a cab and surge rates actually work against Uber psychologically to the customer!
﻿I did math and it doesn't add up, Make your own schedule have the option to have a part-time job to supplement income. Twenty word minimum.....dot dot dot, Compensation UberPool lack of in app Tip support hidden expenses of driving your own vehicle. Do the math and the numbers do not look good., In a project I was doing for school I did a very thorough cost analysis. To make a long story short... Over a two month period I averaged $17 an hour when considering time online. This is working many weekend nights. It broke down to $1.34 per mile and this is only considering miles driven with the passenger in the car not time driving to pick up passengers are waiting for a call. Considering costs like gas depreciation...
﻿The good the bad and the ugly, Make my own schedule meet new people keep people who may be impaired due to alcohol or drugs from hurting/ killing others due to bad judgement giving back to my community, Uber takes a nice chunk from how much the ride costs so drivers don't make as much as they could wear and tear on your personal vehicle older car make take more gas to fuel than newer., Be honest about the tip structure (or lack thereof) instead of making customer believe their ride cost allows for tip when it doesn't
﻿Uber Driver, you are able to work independently and if your work during the weekends you do make pretty good money, a lot of miles on your and car expense like gas, better rating system
﻿Highly disappointed., Telling someone I work at Uber sounds amazing., Third party contract payroll and no growth opportunities Low level job that doesn't require even basic IQ. No recognition of efforts. Covering up mismanagement and taking the blame., Increase the compensation of existing members before recruiting new people. Incentivize the members on their work profile as you do to partners. Appraise the ones who outperform everyone and give them growth.
﻿Driver, Great position when it comes to flexibility, Not really an opportunity for good drivers to move up in any way., 
﻿Great Company, , , 
﻿Great place great people!, Not really! Is a good place to work and have fun!, Keep up with the good work!, 
﻿Driver, Flexibility easy task good pay, They left Austin no health benefits, Work with the City of requiring a fingerprint background check.
﻿Negative Company Culture, excitement of being apart of a start-up, employees don't treat contractors like humans not allowed to eat their food and spoken to like an idiot, 
﻿Inspiring work poor work-life balance., Cutting edge technology agile working environment. You meet some of the smartest people in the industry which is quite inspiring., Ill experienced managers (a lot of first-time managers) who have no intention to retain employees contributing to a horrid work-life balance. Forget family if you want to do 'well' here. Your manager couldn't care if you worked every weekend and the company a very poor attitude towards learning in workplace. Managers don't spend enough time teaching., Get your act together and behave like the big company you are. Hire people to retain them not burn them out.
﻿Driver/Partner Review, Know your city quickly Meet new people Flexible part time job Ease of use in mobile application Many riders are thankful for your service and the ride is very enjoyable. Uber is quick to respond with help needs through the application as well as through their office locations., Riders can be very intoxicated especially during peak hours such as weekends. I have been driving for Uber for the better part of three years and have had two passengers puke in my car. I average around 15 dollars an hour after vehicle expenses. The company does not take out taxes for drivers and you must file quarterly as you are a registered LLC., Taxes please make this an option as it is quite cumbersome to manage our own taxes. Continue to support drivers in every way possible as they will continue to support your customers to the best of their abilities.
﻿Small city teams making real impact and driving change, The company culture is amazing. People joining from startups will feel like home at Uber not only because of the work we do (making a change for the better) but teams operate very independently and company bureaucracy is set to minimal. At Uber you will find the smartest co-workers and passionate leaders., The internal processes in a big company takes time to get used to but that said there are some great efforts made in-house to prevent re-inventing the wheel = Enables us to move fast., Keep on with the transparent communication from top to down.
﻿Best Place to work, If you want to grow this is the best place. Uber is Love and I'm glad to be a part of Uber., No cons! It's a great place., 
﻿Waste of money and time, I work with Uber for more then a year and if in the beginning i like and enjoy the work format independency over time i realize that Uber treat his driver the worst possible way and not as "Partners" as he claim. i would even said that Uber is close to Scam practice company. by miss leading and keep changing his fee policy without informing drivers and with out making sure that drivers can work and earn accordingly...., Uber need to change and treat his "partners" as a real partners. paying well and have a better drivers service, 
﻿Excellent Company to work for, Great work environment super talented people amazing work place, too much work prioritization is a struggle., 
﻿Doesn't pay very good considering you use your own car and must pay for maintenance., Work whenever you want how much you want. Do not expect to make a lot of money., You never know who will get into your car or how busy the hours you work will be. Since you get paid per job it's very important that the jobs keep rolling in. Uber is also recruiting heavily and there is a huge number of cars on the road and therefore meeting the demand as drivers and decreasing our earnings in the long run. The money that we get to keep continues to go down as Uber tries to be the most competitive..., 
﻿it is what you make it, make your own hours; other drivers i've met seem pretty cool, extremely poor communication from corporate; computer glitches can affect your rating and they don't seem to care; some riders can be rude/arrogant; company refuses to allow tipping; impossible to get a job in the main office if you are over the age of 25; wear and tear on your car, add a tipping function to the app so people can tip if they like
﻿Driver, I have met so.e of the most amazing people. And so kind. Interesting and just overall fun, No cons at all . Well maybe one I get so busy I forget to eat, They should really think about having different referral so we can make more money
﻿Tough but doable, , , 
﻿Operations Intern, , , 
﻿DOPs, everyday You need to be super-active in the hurricane. If your want an active environment. This is definitely a place you need to join. You will feel 1 week is just a blink., In the few first weeks you will be burn out as you don't know how to react to the speed of company., 
﻿Good Place, you get the chance to work with and meet many people. It is excellent for networking. You can take off whenever needed. they seem to care, it has its days. I wish it were easier to become full time employee, 
﻿Great company, , , 
﻿NOT MUCH PAY FOR A LOT OF DRIVING!, An alternative to a part time job without the hassle of reporting to a clock!, Extensive miles on vehicle and the pay doesn't equate to the time you must spend on the road to make any kind of money worth your while. Don't recommend going into one of their vehicle through the Xchange program it has an excess amount of money to be paid on a weekly basis so you end up just driving for the note and still seldom get the amount needed. You literally would have to drive around the clock just to see..., Stop being so greedy it appears that half the money earned by the driver's goes in the pocket of Uber temp services don't even take that much. And for God sakes have some kind of direct interaction with you drivers it impossible to speak to anyone EVER...
﻿Don't work in the office!, Hourly pay. You get to sit at a desk., No set schedule or hours. Not direct person you can call for questions. Everything is online. Training absolutely sucks! It's all done via an online group conference and you learn absolutely nothing. You are basically thrown to the wolves. Pay system sucks as well. All pay is done through a temp agency and if you forget to log in your hours on sunday you don't get paid., Come up with a new and better system.
﻿Cultural values promote individuals over teams, Potential to make an impact Smart talented passionate hardworking people Interesting challenges and projects Good perks Moves fast Ability to learn a lot, The cultural values which are you're measured against on performance reviews are very biased towards the type-A personality that toe steps over colleagues to get recognized for work. Individuals accomplishments are recognized and rewarded--not team accomplishments. Teams work in silos--I've seen two teams build the same feature and when they found out instead of working together they continued to launch two similar..., Rethink your values and make it clear you care about personal integrity and teamwork. Do you want to promote being a jerk to grow the company? Does it matter to you? Are the two mutually exclusive? Reward good behavior and set the example from the top. You're pushing out valuable people because the environment can feel like you're being bullied.
﻿Awesome, Create your own schedule. Be your own boss. Meet people from all sectors of the planet . Make easy money driving around enjoying the city. While offering a public service at the same time., Down time while driving is losing money. Idleing is as well. That's no ones fault. Long pick up times for short drop offs. Drunk people with bad attitudes. The rates could be a litte higher. Per minute at least., Less app crashing would be nice. That's probably unavoidable. Maybe higher rates in the future? I really have no advice to give . Well done Uber.
﻿Drivers don't matter, Flexibility is awesome and the app has some nice bells and whistles. Matching you with a ride before your current ride ends and matching you with rides that take you towards home., Super picky about how the car looks the smallest dent or scratch disqualifies you. People don't care if your fender is popping out a half inch. Either fares not high enough or not giving a better percentage to drivers. $10-$12 an hour average does not cover wear and tear on vehicle. Not sure which navigation Uber is using but it sux. It takes you to the backside of an address and seems to take the longest route. Not..., Add tipping to your app and give more love to your drivers. Stop relying so heavily on rider ratings.
﻿UBER Rideshare Driver, Calls from the uber cellphone app are controlled by their system. Don't have to look for passengers to drive much. Get paid weekly. Work when you want to. Learn to read map and new roads to travel. Can be fun at times., No Tips and uber does not provide a tip function when the clients book the rides. Don't know where you are going and how far till passengers are picked up. Drive car full of people 5-6 and get the same fare. Black SUV's don't get promotions Uber requests driver to get a business license for San Francisco later after starting to drive. No consideration for mountain driving mileage and wear n tear on your cars transmission..., Make us employees not Independent drivers. Add a tip function to the credit card system and encourage riders to tip us. Driving 100 rides is very hard to get a bonus. Stop taking most of the fares. The percentage is too high for what drivers go through out there.
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Driving with Uber is not a family supporting job, Nice to make few extra bucks around your own schedule. Great when you are between jobs., Definitely not worth working full time. Not much better than an unskilled labor at retail outlets. (after accounting for Uber fees wear and tear on your car and taxes), Try to lower your fee from current 25% maybe to a flat fee per ride.
﻿Uber X driver, Networking Schedule Outside Social Own boss, Drunk people rude people you destroy your car low pay long hours, 
﻿Driver, You can work when It is convenient for you., You are not making good money driving a lot but not making good money., Pay your workers what they are worth. Stop taking all the money for your self.
﻿Uber driver, Quick and mostly easy money, Price is starting to drop for riders which means lower pay for drivers, 
﻿Not for everyone, - Fast-paced and growing at an incredible rate - Lots of ownership - Passionate / driven colleagues, - Little to no work/life balance - Long hours and pressure to stay late - Intense culture, 
﻿Driver, Nice Job for newcomers who like to have some income or additional income Team helps in processing documents quickly within 4 working days after submitting application and relevant information Good for those who like adventure and people, Lacks personal touch with it's employees Always on the road. Very risky job. Accidents happen not caused Insurance burden in on You No signed contracts benefits and respect to any individual, Find time to meet and greet people who build you up. If there's a problem anywhere try to meet and sort it out. Not just rely on the feedback you receive from the star rating.
﻿Uber dost, Prossess is good and give us to even money but need to more improvement in apps, Change word anytime.to handle the process in Mumbai management is not good pls change the management team.and give more space to Uber dost to handle the process, Pls do paper work with Uber dost possess format
﻿Marketing Manager, I can't be happier to work with brightest talent in town., The most cons is work life balance. It's startup so you know it., NA
﻿Driver, Pretty easy and convenient way to make money in free time. Everything is online but there is a help desk in case you had any questions., Pay isn't worth the gas and mileage., 
﻿Terrible for drivers, There are no pros for being a driver. The rate they pay is laughable., Awful rates for drivers. Don't get paid while driving 15+ minutes for a few minute drop off that pays three dollars. Even before taking gas into account the pay is less than unemployment. The app needs a ton of work coming from a software developer., 
﻿Rewarding job rough work/life balance, Colleagues are so awesome that working feels like hanging with smart friends all day taking risks is rewarded the work is super interesting and changing people's lives, It's hard to find enough time outside of work to relax women have to be ready to speak up aggressively to be heard you have to push back hard to stand up for your opinion, Tune into who you're promoting - it sounds like the loudest (and not necessarily the best/smartest) voice always wins
﻿Job, make your own hours okay pay, not enough pay. you,

﻿Marketing Manager, The work perks are great, Work life balance - you live in the office., 
﻿Frat House, - Young and incredibly energetic/passionate people that like to tackle difficult challenges. - Nice offices with free breakfast and lunch! - Like-minded colleagues, - Little to no structure - Immature and inexperienced managers - Truly feels like a frat house. Awful culture for experienced professional women to work in. - Aggressive and pushy: No respect for any sort of processes or structure, You're losing smart professional women left right and centre. Do something about it! Diversity in the workplace is not just a PR activity or lip service. "Managers" are so inexperienced that they don't know what to do with smart staff. Beer chugging contests at 2pm on a Tuesday? Big no-no. Learn to grow UP! You're no longer a scrappy startup working out of a garage.

﻿Like any other big tech company now, standard tech company perks - free lunch some Uber credits usual snacks etc., pitches itself as a startup while operating like a large tech company. fairly slow pace of work but could have just been my own personal experience, 
﻿Uber driver, Flexible work any hours you like, Its not an ideal full-time job this week I did 54 hours and got $16 per hour, 
﻿Varies market to market, High-energy fast paced environment. Lunch provided dinner provided gym paid insurance., Oof - where to begin. Feels like an episode of the Apprentice. All Type A personalities highly-competitive and back stabbing. Very bro-y culture. Unlimited vacation is just a way of bullying you into taking none., Ego is a trickle down culture
﻿Uber Pros and Cons, paid weekly or everyday flexibility choose which area you want work be your own boss, Full-time not recommended no phone number for disputes summer is the worse time to work changes are made from one day to the next., Stay the same stop switching up things everyday make sure your have a number for customers yes customer need a number to make a complaint or if they have an issue with a credit card paymentemail is not enough.

﻿Decent - Could be better, Work your own schedule they provide insurance, App platform it sufficient at best (needs work) hard to contact customer support (no phone # to call) when they offer special incentives it is hard to obtain they raised the minimum fair to give them more money not the driver., You know what to do - listen to and respect your drivers
﻿Nice side job, Riders can be obnoxious and inconsiderate. If you plan on driving Friday or Saturday nights you will have to deal with drunk passengers. Individual drunk riders are usually fine however groups of drunk friends are often loud and obnoxious. Some riders (even sober ones) will put in the wrong pickup location. Others will not be ready when you arrive at the pickup location. Unlike Lyft with Uber your far does not start..., Start the fare as soon as driver arrives at pickup location. Improve customer service for drivers. Make it easier for riders to drop their pin at the correct pickup location., 
﻿Awesome company and Awesome people, People are passionate about what they do. Choose your schedule it's more about what you put in than how long you work for., The hours can be long but you won't be without something to do.,

The culture of the company and the autonomy I have are unparalleled. -I love my team. -The problems we were work on are making the world a better place and our solutions are immediately implemented., -The big downside is that we work super hard. Very very long hours. Honestly though I prefer long hours where I feel super engaged than shorter hours where I feel less engaged which is what I get here. This environment is not for everyone though., Think through the long-term sustainability of working this hard. Other than that keep being awesome.
﻿Great Overall Experience, As an intern you have lots of hands on experience, Lack of formal on boarding training/orientation, 
﻿The Uber Experience, Extremely fast-paced environment amazing culture very smart people around every corner. It's a great feeling to work with people that very driven and passionate about everything they do, The fast pace might not be comfortable for everyone you need to be ready to handle everything on the fly and multitask pretty seriously, 
﻿Great opportunity to Succeed., From the day I have joined I have a great feeling that I have got an excellent platform to exhibit my abilities and grow as fast as I can. #Super-pumped #Enthusiastic, Pros are at the higher side so I have not found any Cons till date. Hope I will not come across any., Do not stop being enthusiastic as you are now. Hope to see more office spaces with more number of people
﻿Unfair payment structure to drivers, Nothing good really to talk about Uber, On October 23/16 I have a payout for $2.72 for a ride in south Florida. I went to Uber fare estimating feature and I enter the exact route and it estimated it for $5-6 uberx. Really? You guys are ripping me off., 
﻿Good job, Flexible hours get to meet all sorts of people. Perfect job if you're going to school It's nice just to get in your car whenever you want, Needy customers GPS doesn't always work which is really a nuisance Seeing what you make and the difference between that and after you pay taxes kind of brutal, Seeing what you make and the difference between that and after you pay taxes kind of brutal. I would think that rubric could be able to pay their drivers a little more
﻿Uber partner, Talking and developing relationships with people from all walks of life. You limit how much money you make and determine it. Travel and site see your whole state and some., Never knowing the attitude of the customer when arriving. Paying for the tolls up front. Not knowing where customers are going until you arrive. They do not calculate nor do they compensate you for the miles traveled to pickup a customer, This is a freelance company it doesn't have career levels. It's simply log on and work and log off and go home.
﻿Nice way to make money and meet people, Work whenever you want to., Lots of expenses that you eat., 
﻿Doesn't pay Drivers enough. Needs improvement, Flexible schedule. Incentives. Surge pricing pay., Pool is too low and cost drivers money. Needs to be re vamped. Tipping isn't on the platform like LYFT has. Has to be added to be competitive and take care of drivers. Outsource driver call center to Phillipines so clueless about what drivers go through so really no help. Bad reputation after so many lawsuits, Make significant changes to improve pay and driver morale. Bring driver customer support back to the US!!
﻿Huber driver, I like uhber... Cause I work at my pase and enjoy self producing time skill and development for my company., Does everyone like uber??? To be on time. I develoled time consistantcy till I learn new geographics., Geographic area help spread the uhber word.
﻿General manager, You get a flavour of startup, Set processes less scope of experimentation, 
﻿professional Driver, you can work when ever and how long, you must have your own vehicle, make it so you can start the buy on your car not lease
﻿great part time gig, very flexible schedule great money, dealing with people all the time, 
﻿Great place to grow and learn horrible work-life balance, Immense learning opportunity - you are surrounded by the brightest minds in the world and huge amounts of data Opportunity to be part of a company that is changing the world and you can see the results of your work Great perks for the most part - great offices lunch snacks company events Motivating work opportunities to grow, Work-life balance is non-existent. Nobody makes you work but you have to because there's so much to do each day Company is just starting to think about career growth and learning opportunities so you have to figure it out on your own Little opportunity to advance if you're not highly specialized or come from a big market - if you worked in a small market moving to HQ or larger offices is extremely difficult., Invest more in people - create workshops classes etc so that people can actually learn more and grow
﻿Uber driver, Flexibility. Surge pricing. Easy way to make extra cash. You can get paid instantly by transferring your earnings to their gobank account they provide to you. Otherwise get paid weekly via direct deposit, Its not what it used to be Erratic pay. Sometimes i have a great night snd sometimes its a waste of time...too many drivers gets surge pricing down. Regular pay is terrible. Poor management and lack of support. No one knows what they are doing. The only way to get anything done is going to the office which is a huge inconvenience. I literally emailed uber 3 separate times and got 3 different answers for the same question..., Train your employees uniformly and streamline everything. Pay your drivers more. Uber is just not worth it anymore unless there is surge
﻿Implementattion specialist, good job great job good, this is really a good place to work, great management
﻿Love it!, - Very transparent company. Weekly all-hands keep me informed of what all the other product teams are working on. TK (CEO) also does weekly Q&A and is very honest so I always have a good sense of what direction the company is going or I can find out - Extremely passionate people who love their craft and are experts in their own field. Very inspiring to be surrounded by these type of people - So many resources......, - I have had a great experience working for Uber but I believe it has largely to do with what team you are on. My manager and lead are very compassionate people who are invested in how I grow as a designer. Make sure your manager/lead are people you would like to work with and learn from during your interview. Makes all the difference! - I have a really long commute. Would like if there were better commuter benefits, 
﻿pros cons, , , 
﻿driver, very flexible job you will make good money if you are willing to put in some work, need to treat their drivers better, 
﻿Engineer Manager at Uber, A lot of very smart people working at an extremely fast pace. The company has amazing focus on where it wants to go, Work-life balance and stress in the work place, Management assumes that everyone lives to work. There are people like me in the company that have a spouse and children where a work-life balance is a necessity
﻿Good for those who want to learn a lot, Plenty of things to learn due to the start-up culture Lots of room to roam around to experiment Progressive environment Good support from HQ Equities!, Too many young individuals - hence lacking the proper direction Cut-throat environment - employees "disappear" without pre-emptive measurement Extremely high attrition rate and hence the flow of information always disappear YOU WILL WORK YOUR BUTT OFF, Work hard on the attrition rate of the company. Note: average tenure in Uber is 1 year.

﻿You get what you give, You can work as many hours as you want to. You make your own schedule for a 24 hour period. You can take a break when ever you would like. Your able to drive your whole state. How hard you hustle is going to determine how much you make., A lot of wear and tear on your care and lots of miles will be put on. You dont have a person you can talk to when and if you have any problems. emails only, there needs to be an option for the rider at the end of his or her ride to tip the driver. also you guys should open a customer service help line for drivers
﻿experience review, great place to work. great colllegues and learning experience, nothing. work pressure is there but that will be there in startup, keep the momemtum
﻿startup company which is booming, the company is expanding their business and there are lots of opportunities to get promote and start new business., the whole company is so busy there are no one have the free time to teach you know-how. So try harder is very important., 
﻿Okay student job, Work on your own time, Too many drivers Uber keeps lowering rate, 
﻿Very Bad, Haven't seen any yet. None. None None, Been trying to start for weeks now. I'm trying to do this on the side. I know I'm not going to get a lot of money out of it. Their support is a joke like somebody mentioned. I uploaded all of my paperwork. It was not going through and I had to contact them. After weeks of standard reply's they finally sorted it out. Now I had to go through a background check. There is no way you can do that through your account profile...., Figure out you system.
﻿Don't think this will provide for your family., Can pick my own schedule., Short fares are hardly worth it. Sometimes wait an hour or more for a fare. Flat-out not worth it!, 
﻿Great Company but..., Flexible scheduling Great colleagues Amazing benefits/perks Great transitioning job not for long term., Employees are vastly underpaid Little room for internal growth, Spend more time developing employees and change the pay. If you can pay new drivers grand start up bonuses you can afford a bonus to exemplary employees or a 401K match
﻿Driver, Enables me to work and set my own time., Work is hard to come by as you sit and wait for an assignment, Offer ways that drivers can get more rides.
﻿Drank the Kool-Aid, Working with self-motivated individuals that come together for a greater purpose. Everyone you meet will amaze you with their knowledge and it's crazy how 95% of the time you'd be friends with them outside of work., As Uber is still in its startup phase processes are constantly changing and not everyone is aligned all the time internationally so working with different cities can be a little challenging. But it will get better as we continue growing., Keep up with hiring the right people for the right jobs. It's very important to fill the spaces but only with the right people.
﻿great and fantastic enjoy driving, get paid every week and on time. Enjoy meeting people. They work with you on everything and give out bonuses., I haven't really found to many cons to this job. Maybe the fact that I have to pay for my gas., 
﻿driver, Easy hours. Guaranteed hourly pay as long a you meet certain requirements., Cost of car maintenance oil gas ect. No tips through app., ADD TIPS TO THE APP!
﻿Great benefits bad communication, I get to set my schedule around school classes every semester. I also get to attend fun events. The hourly pay is great and the Uber employees I've worked with are always great., The communication between our main uber office and uber remote markets (aka me) is pretty bad. I have not been trained to use many of the systems/websites that I need to know during office hours. I feel very un-knowledgeable about Uber policies. Plus I have joined Uber at a very bad time for the year I have been working with them they have literally changed almost every aspect of Uber: from Uber Expert responsibilities..., Please improve communication between Greenlight Centers and their remote markets. Also improve support services for Partners and Riders.
﻿Desperate people who dont speak english, There is No pros for me. For desperate people who are unable to work and can live off $8 an hr.  it's ok, Once you ad gas and wear-and-tear on your car you may make $10 an hr if you work straight through. Here in Miami you probably make around $4 and hr May-Oct., Let your drivers earn at least $15 and hr and requite that they speak at least some english
﻿Forget Uber before they forget you, You can be your own boss. You can sometimes get good tips., You have no control over the pay rate. You have no control over the app or over what happens with your equipment., Stop screwing your drivers by dropping the pay rate not once not twice but several times. You do not back up your drivers. You have a bogus rating system. You say you hire a third party trainer but I am speculative about that.
﻿Awesome, Fast paced exciting company. Lots of personal development opportunities. Super exciting campaigns on-demands events partnerships., The main cons would be worklLife balance - lots of weekends late nights and after hours., 
﻿It's always interesting here!, Lots of room to take on new responsibilities get involved with exciting new projects and help others succeed. You're encouraged to "be an owner" and take responsibility for projects and initiatives that you care about. The organization has the right idea about leadership and development. Managers work alongside their reports. Their job is to choose a direction for the team and to be a champion for their team with..., There's a strong expectation that everyone here will support and identify with the company's mission. If you think Uber is making the world a better place -- or if you're just super-enthusiastic to work on our meaty data science engineering UX and operational challenges -- this is a plus. But if you're not into it this won't be a great place to work. A lot of our compensation (and nearly all of our annual bonus)..., 
﻿Mama I made it!, *The first and biggest pro of them all is that you get to work for a company that's still in its start-up stage. There's so much to do and a lot more to learn. You get to see how a lot of things that were just ideas on a white board come to life and fall into place. *Being yourself is encouraged it may not seem like a big thing but when you've worked for companies that try to tailor your personality and tell what..., Only con I wish I didn't have to go through an agency to get my foot in the door. I'm a contractor now but I believe I'll get hired on because I love what I do., Keep up the good work don't let us down this is my dream job and as long you guys keep pushing for new heights I'll keep moving up with you guys.
﻿Drivers fee, Drivers pick their on time to work. Work as long as you want. Weekly pay. Instant pay. Drivers can go to any city and make money., Pat is small. More trips about only two per hour in most cases. Not able to speak to a rep. Email everything. Passengers first., Get more staff in Orlando. Keep doing a great job.
﻿A great company changing the world with passionate people, -Everyone is passionate about the company and mission -Company is still young enough where you get to build infrastructure that will be used by the company for years. -Tons of teams and products to work on -- once you're in you really see that there is so much going on behind the app!, -People work A LOT. Depending on where you are the experience changes. For instance in SF people are at the office for 10-12 hours but mix in play with work. However in Seattle people work fewer hours but are all work all the time. -Company is really focused on saving money and cutting costs this causes perks and benefits to be sub-compared to Facebook or Google but still really good! -Company is still young..., Make sure to keep rewarding the employees for their work. The area that Uber is in is really controversial and competitive and the employees can feel that and get pretty worn out. Continue to listen to the engineers' concerns especially about dev tools so that we can be more effective in writing and pushing code.
﻿Driver, You can make your own hours, Not enough money for the trips you take, 
﻿Novelty Item Not a Serious Service., Fun to meet people and show them your city. Great to learn the ins-and-outs of your area., Paycuts and a glitchy app make this job much more trouble than it's worth. I made less than minimum wage even when driving smart and working hard. Regular pay cuts (and rising Uber fees) over the last year have made this basically unprofitable as a full-time job. Uber now takes 1/4 of every fair you work. Also if you don't work the app exactly right you will lose hours of revenue simply due to the way the Uber..., Due to fees and price cuts this is now a minimum wage job. Tipping needs to be included. It's impossible for a waiter to get by on their less than minimum wage salary alone why would you expect your drivers to go without tips as well?
﻿Great for Riders awful for driver, Make your own schedule and that;s pretty much it, Pay after you deduct your costs is absurdly low.. bout$-$6 an hour isf you count your down time. For example I left the house 11am and drove until 6pm and neted $48 with my app being on about 6 hours the rest was coming back from airport and long trips. Uber keep lowering the fees and some rides turn out cheaper than a bus ride which is great for riders but absolutely not worth it for drivers, 
﻿Don't drive for Uber, You can choose your own hours., It's very expensive to drive for Uber and it pays less than minimum wage. You don't get paid for any miles or time that you drive to the pickup spot or from the dropoff spot so you will end up driving as much unpaid time as you are getting paid for maybe even more unpaid than paid! You are not reimbursed for anything AND Uber charges you 20-25% of your fare on top of all your other expenses! The guarantees are not truthful., Figure out a win/win proposition. You're quite genius in figuring out how to make money off of deception and taking advantage of people but it isn't fair or ethical.
﻿Driver, Turn the app on and off whenever, Main con is the pay and lack of transparency around pay. For example Uber has this new "upfront fare guarantee" where they charge say $27 for a ride. But the ride's distance and time comes out to only $20. The driver gets 75% of the fare - $15. But Uber keeps the whole $27 plus $1.65 booking fee. This new scam is costing riders millions and they don't even realize it. It's also unfair to drivers as drivers..., Transparency to all! How hard is that for goodness sakes. You oughta be investigated at the highest levels!
﻿Happy Driver, , , 
﻿Good Side Job, Work anytime you want to, Make minimum wage after deducting costs, Pay your drivers more and cut the promotions
﻿Driving for Uber, Not enough money to live on., Raise the fare so we can make a living wage., 
﻿Aggressive, , , 
﻿Could have been better, Flexible and informal work culture Great office Surrounded by some of the smartest people around, Informal work culture makes everyone lazy Marketing department does not do as much as it should, There needs to be more accountability else it's just a waste of resources and time.
﻿Dollar taxi, The people you meet will make you laugh. Some of them are really great. You get to vent sometimes and you learn the city really fast., You are not going to make the kind of money Uber promises. They go out of their way to let you know that they have promotions but they do not have anything in place to help you track your progress to reach the hourly guarantee goals., Do not charge any less for these rides than you already are. Customers do not deserve to have a dollar taxi that they can trash and disrespect.
﻿Superpumped to be here, - work with cutting edge technology - super talented people - really fast paced environment - your opinion really counts - little bureaucracy, - might be too fast-paced for some folks - it's a work in progress (i.e. a startup environment), Overall a superb place to work - i would work on preserving the company culture and improving the work/life balance.
﻿Uber driver, Working with Uber is amazing and the best thing is that you can make your own schedule, I didn't find any cons so i'd say _None_ for the moment, Nothing to say ! Everything is outstanding and Uber knows how to keep their employees and clients safe and satisfied. Keep it up !
﻿Tier 2 Driver Support, Uber really knows how to show their employees how much they value them. They have created such a great culture and work environment. From providing meals for all their employees to free Uber credits and a comfortable dress policy., The only Con that I had was having to go through the staffing agency in order to get the job., Hire Direct!
﻿Driver, I like to deal with people with different culture., I can work is when the demand is high., Improve the demand
﻿CSR in COE, Inspiring workplace plenty of possibilities incredible growth and unbelievable atmosphere. Every employee here feels valuable and respected not to mention the perfect work environment., Working hours are somewhat "flexible" in the sense of overtime it's not expected but highly encouraged. Also there is a difference in salaries between the same level of employees with different languages., Manage the growth try not to let the place grow over your head! Other than that keep up the good work! Great job in making everyone unleash their true potential by projects maybe you could incentivize them.
﻿Culture focus and expertise, Uber has the smartest team I've worked with. So far even as a seasoned programmer have learned more than I thought possible. Everyone here is ready to support you as you make one the most innovative products of our time. It's obvious that this company excels but it's not as obvious why; under the pressure there are hundreds of colleagues that can take your contribution and make it more., Get ready for the ride of your life. There is no substitution., Keep your head up as the coders put their heads down.
﻿Deceiving!!!! Complete racquet, Fast start easy financing for cars. Money transferred directly in my account. No fuss or puss. Lots of miles for less then minimum wage. Dishonest about how much can you make. Lies about how Insurnace works. Lies about how you are also held liable during an accident., Expect you to be dishonest about you driving for uber during car accident investigation. Since your non commercial Insurnace doesn't cover paying customers. Not fully explained how you owe 15% social security taxes on what you make plus unemployment taxes. So you end up making below $7 an hour most of the time driving., Take care of drivers driverless cars are far away
﻿UberX Driver, Finally had a work life balance! Work when you want where you want as much or as little as you want., In this economy prices are rising for almost everything. This is one of the few things that for less than good reasons the price has gone down. I basically gave people control of my car while on a trip. Temperature music route speed.. should one not be paid for that? Unless you love driving around and meeting new people this is a break even job. None of my customers ever complained about the rate before it went down...., Turning this into a break even job you have changed the type of person that will work for you. Now it will be people who need money right away. Care about money in hand now even at greater cost later. Do they still give water or candies to customers? doubt it. Worst still riders safety is likely at greater risk due to drop in quality and professional style drivers. Now they must get in as many short trips as they can...
﻿Oc, People working here have good education background., It is not well established you have to learn by yourself and some system not support stuff you should work it out by your self, I have no specific advice but if we could talk more on employee development that's would be fine.
﻿Multi-City Driver, I began driving for Uber in Tampa FL. I also drove in Orlando FL and Chicago IL when I moved back north. I loved being able to work whenever I wanted. I could work after my regular 8-5 on weekends and holidays I was already getting paid for by my regular job. During peak hours the pay was great. I was able to make an average of $300+ only doing pickups from clubs/bars on Friday and Saturday nights for..., You put a lot of miles/wear and tear on your car if you work often. You are constantly buying gas. Depending on how much you're making it can negate working. If you do club/bar pickup (where a lot of the money is) you're sometimes dealing with rude/belligerent people. One customer almost threw up on my car. Another was verbally abusive but his friend put him in check and tipped me handsomely for my trouble., In the cities with taxi establishment pushback it would be nice if drivers knew that Uber was behind them and they didn't feel like they were on their own.
﻿Exciting Ride!, Amazing peers highly motivated and ambitious. Inspiring challenges and problems to solve will keep you constantly on your toes. Innovation is valued decisions are taken quick and the learning curve is steep. There's a great amount of change needed to scale the business and support the company's growth in all fronts and you will be able to build and contribute to it., High ambitions translate into high expectations and the productivity bar is high. There's flexibility in working hours but still a predominant American business culture that needs to open up to cultural differences., Work in supporting more work-life balance (working smarter and not always harder) and start focusing more attention and resources to provide with career opportunities as the business becomes more mature.
﻿good job that allows a lot of freedom. I never had problems with customers, freedom. you make your own hours, sometimes you can get clients who are less than polite, be more fair to your drivers
﻿Great Opportunity to Earn Extra Money, Uber is a great opportunity for a wide cross variety of people to earn additional income or to supplement their income. It allows for complete flexibility in scheduling so it works for students homemakers retired workers and displaced workers to earn money. For the most part Uber customers are friendly and love Uber. As a driver you meet people from all walks of life and who are in town for a lot of reasons from..., Overall my experience with Uber has been very positive. My only area of concern would be the recruitment of drivers sometimes floods the system making catching rides scarce from the driver's vantage point. Waiting 20 or more minutes between rides can be costly for a driver. As the company grows and ridership increases more drivers are needed and recently we have had a large surge of ex-taxi drivers joining the network...., Keep up the great work Uber is a great company and is re-inventing the way we as American's access public transportation while traveling and in town. I truly believe Uber is making our streets safer. As a retired police officer I cannot recommend Uber enough. Make the referral system a little more transparent.

﻿Overnight, You get payed everyweek Extra money on holidays Cashiering, Low pay Low hours No room to grow in the company, None if u haven't already understood why people complain n u tend not to fix the problem
﻿Uber As the Alternative Source of Income, Good system with fast response for all issues raised., None for the time being,

﻿Communications Associate, Absolutely everyone at Uber is a highly competent and intelligent person. Everyone is focused at all times trying to figure out how to make things happen rather than just meeting a schedule and "doing their job"., Be ready to hustle at all times. The rhythm at which the company is growing and the pace at which it changes is unbelievably fast so no challenge or day at the office will ever be the same as the previous one., 
﻿Great for extra income not to be taken as employment for daily bills, Good money when 100% accepting requests distances are great when long rides and great conversations with riders. Visit new cities and learn new routes, Deteriorating of automobile too many miles possible mechanical failure of auto. Too many UBERpool requests and riders can be sometimes rowdy and loud, Removal or switch of UBERpool and UBERX icons on app. UBERpool 60% sometimes good
﻿Practical chaotic and aggressive, - Cultural values are practical and solution oriented - Everyone is encouraged to be aggressive - Hands off environment where no one tells you what to work on. You tell a story of why your work is impactful and whoever delivers most impact rises., - Need a better reward policies to make sure employees are also focused on long-term impact. - If you're not mature enough do not join., Keep moving fast
﻿Great Place to Work!!!, Benefits Free Meals Dynamic/Fast Paces work environment Very young and ambitious workforce. The perks are also excellent!, Long hours are expected and many people complain that their base salaries would be higher at other firms. Overall it's all worth it!, Ensure that everyone at Uber Technologies has a clear career path if they meet/exceed their expectations. Other than that everything is great!
﻿Uber Partner, pay isn't great. sometimes you have to drive out of your way, raise rates for drivers, 
﻿Driver-Partner Awesome Experience, Autonomy Flexibility Great Riders Great Opportunity for entrepreneur minded individuals with good work ethics and passion for providing a great service., At this level all I can do is recommend Uber to both drivers and riders. I want business cards to promote for returning riders., Hire me in St. Louis to be a part of growing our service in this area. I am up for it and ready to get with it. Never been more ready to be a part of a company on a corporate level ever.
﻿Uber is ripping me off, Flexible schedule work whenever you want to, Uber takes 25% of your earnings promises you a minimum of $20 during rush hours but your REAL EARNINGS are a whole lot less more like $10 to $12 an hour sometimes less. The worst part isyou get a different customer support rep every time you need help then you start over all over again trying to explain to the support person what you need. The support by e-mail people are very nice yet useless either because they..., A toll free or non toll free number to talk to a live person from the US preferably or someone who speaks English. It feels like the company is run from India
﻿Just felt used, Flexible hours decent wages if you drive at the right times., Company gives off the feeling that you don't matter to them at all you're just another driver that they will replace if they decide you're not good enough., Top down show your drivers real appreciation.
﻿Community Operations Specialist, Awesome people managers work environment great food and snacks fast pace life free Uber rides to work and for personal uses., There should be more focus on training people to acquire more skills, Keep doing the great things
﻿Chill, , , 
﻿It pays below minimum wage, , , 
﻿DRIVER, Flexible hours of work., Not profitable enough and has risk of life., Try to raise income.
﻿Boss, great place to be employed, you may get tired so take some rests between riders, continue to do what you are doing
﻿Brand Ambassador, Promoted Uber in Colorado and the San Francisco Bay Area. Demonstrated the app to potential users delivered key messaging and increased users., The marketing coordinator at Uber Denver was extremely difficult to get a hold of and often would never respond to communication at all. Very poor at managing brand ambassadors. Not at all interested in growing the skills of ambassadors., Invest more resources into brand ambassador program so that ambassadors feel valued and learn during the program.
﻿UBER is bad idea, Very low wages. UBER start taking 35% in Toronto. About $16 per hour before taxes gasoline and car maintenance. Customers treat you like garbage. UBER keep sending you threatening messages after every bad review without giving you possibility to explain what was happen. Keep saying that driver is covered by UBER insurance till driving for UBER but never send you insurance number or any proof of that., You killing this business with your greed. Specially bad idea is UBER Pool. Hopefully some other company will take this business from UBER., 
﻿Everyday pay day, Hey I need some cash okay let me go for a drive bam 20 bucks for the club entrance, Eehhh we may have ever to wait an hour or two, Can we make 60 plus or a hundred and hour
﻿MIsleading, You make your own hours own boss Paid weekly, Very misleading. Contacted Uber Support and every response is the same and I can not get anything resolve. Being told one thing by your employees and then doing something completely different is a horrible way to run a business. You make plenty of money of drivers like me and going back on your word is bad business., Train your employees. I was told after 75 rides in my first month that my AWARD was $650. I have emails and proof that I would be AWARDED my bonus and now being told I'm incorrect. BAD BAD way to get drivers.
﻿Perfect fit for hardworking tech-savvy and superpumped people, Flat org structure tons of projects to get your hands on supportive and inspiring managers still ground-zero opportunity in which you can contribute on a daily-basis experiment and immediately see the result of your effort., Not all markets receive attention equilly (China India etc. have more priority incl. local product team resources) uncertain career path (good to have flat structure but don't know where the road will take me in 1-2 years)., Love your people-centric empowering management style.

Offer very competitive package for you to join = "never vested stocks" fair salary fair benefits and some "considered cool" perks. Hiring team does make a great job for you..., Turn over is about a year a couple of months in its easy to realize the brainwash and all reckless decisions; Senior Management are a bunch of "start ups" professionals; HR team is very weak and has no say at all on restructuring process. HR is not functional at all. No Voice and no brain. The same way they hire launch in a city they dismiss people very reckless., HR should be independent and do their work.

﻿Don't bother, Set your own scheduled and days off., Wear and tear on YOUR car. Low mileage rate. When you factor in the cost for preventative maintenance insurance tires repairs car washes etc. you will barely come out ahead.

﻿Uber X driver, Flexibility (main reason of the 2 star rating) ease to get quickly approved to drive. Uber has started offering guaranteed peak hour wages similar to Lyft although there are problems that they are still working out (hopefully)., Driver income is variable depending on rides. More importantly drivers are a commodity being used up to grow the company. Fares have consistently decreased as the company competes with Lyft. The driver's get stuck with the results. The actual net income is low oftentimes being less than minimum wage with your vehicle being taking quite the beating in mileage wear and tear. Riders have consistently become less pleasant..., Start hiring people with true operational business experience outside of the tech sector because you need to put people in power with an understanding of investments in the most valuable commodity for long term growth the drivers (training compensation benefits Uber/Driver communication driver satisfaction retention of the best drivers).

Full-time conversion offer was decent. - Peers are nice and friendly - Company..., - Uber has become so ambitious that the environment in the office is kind of a mess - Many engineers are realizing the tactics that the engineering directors are using to fire people and are extremely unhappy with the company - People work extremely long hours and recognition and promotion doesn't really recognize that - There is really no "trust" between engineers and management as engineers tend to think that..., It's clear that Uber is ambitious and everything it does is either for the greater good or "necessary evil." Even though this sort of cut-throat environment is working so far it's definitely not sustainable. Nevertheless people will still want to join Uber so I doubt much will change.
﻿Uber...., very nice people team and supporting leads, Process is not organised yet, Please take employees feedback frequently about process and leads
﻿I loved driving for Uber on the weekends., It was really great meeting people around the city and making some extra cash driving around.

﻿Aggressive jerks welcome home!, Uber is a fascinating business model and the international scope fast growth and leading market position are addicting for business-case junkies. Many Co-workers are smart and hard-working if somewhat dull (but at huge cost - see below) "Cocktail-party cool" means you'll be popular at parties because everyone has an opinion on Uber and are always interested to learn about the inside. If this matters to you. Unique..., Where to begin...Uber is basically Game of Thrones translated into SV workplace. No company churns as much as Uber even at 7000 employees - the amount of chaos is unnecessary and exhausting due to inexperienced management and ingrained top-down aggressive culture. Aggressive jerks and huge self-serving egos are not only tolerated they are rewarded. You will be instructed to ignore other teams and duplicate effort..., Doesn't matter since growth continues - would be hard to change a top-down culture anyways. Inexperienced senior management is one of the highest risks - get a real adult into senior management - where is the Eric Schmidt or Sheryl Sandberg to make the right decisions & build a sustainable company culture?
﻿Contractors abound - full time positions are challenging, Great environment good salaries/hourly rates wonderful perks very good and open-minded employees challenging and innovative work always., Premature startup with refreshingly little change control and process but this lends to some disorganization and disconnect between departments. Somewhat of a popularity contest advancing in the company. Very long hours frequently and co-workers look down on others that don't put in extra time., Solidify relationships between teams and streamline efforts while maintaining the startup benefit of low "process overkill" such as complex change management.

The work environment is fast-paced and each employee (engineer designer data scientist etc.) moves quickly and efficiently to meet their goals. Everyone holds themselves and each other to a high standard and this creates a culture of passion commitment and most importantly collaboration. Uber's driven employees paired with the noble mission..., Uber is a rapidly growing company and as a result the onboarding process could be streamlined a bit more. But otherwise I don't have any complaints!, 
﻿Amazing culture and autonomy, Significant autonomy and opportunity to lead projects Creativity is highly valued Upbeat and exciting culture, None to share so far, Maintaining smaller teams will be important to maintain culture.
﻿UberEats, Fun always something new/never gets boring good exercise in NY delivering on bike plenty of flexibility with hours  and great support. Use PROMO CODE xh17t7gaue if you join as a driver for UberEats for a bonus., the algorithm in the app can be improved so I travel less between trips not steady work but good for P/T or weekends, Expand to Queens/Long Island
﻿Great job while attending school, Create your own flexible schedule, Low paying on non-surging calls, Pay drivers for the mileage spent heading towards calls/rides
﻿driver, I like working with people.., hard work with little pay ....and no why to replay to the harsh criticism from uber . my ratings have drop from 4.80 to 4.78..for no reason..., 
﻿Uber BV nederland, great workplace friendly environment extraordinary facilities., too much importance to degree and institution, U rock guys
﻿FLOODED DRIVER MARKET IN HOUSTON TEXAS, Be your own boss and make your own schedule, Seems Uber has flooded the market with drivers and that has taken a serious toll on my income. Just tonight I waited 2 hours and NOT ONE RIDE I gave up and that is what I am doing more and more. Frankly driving for Uber just isn't what it use to be now you are lucky to make a decent wage for the time invested. I personally would not recommend Driving for Uber its a smoke and mirror game and I am not willing to play..., better take care of you drivers the are the one that butter our bread but that's ok you wont read communication with this is like hit r miss rarely do I get a response that is subject indicative. This company has serious communication issues to day the LEAST!
﻿Remote Driver Support, Casual atmosphere. Discount on service. Relatively high hourly for work at home., No path to permanent employment. Forever temp position (at the time at least). Invasive security policy (They want the rights to complete access to your personal equipment used to do the job) Really disorganized., it's been a while so hopefully things have changed
﻿Uber Cheats drivers, Own schedule blah blah blah Palm Springs is good only when the season picks up. October to May, Less money sometimes. U don't know when you are gonna get a good ride. The company cheats you out of money. Their support is so bad overseas support do kit understand English or how to resolve a problem., Stop cheating drivers on their trips. Everytime I have to email in because their app doesn't calculate right. Uber never sends the money back that they owe you. Their support is from India and God knows where. Their support gets a 1 star. They would of been deactivated a long time ago.The LA Support goes thru accounts and emails you saying you will be deactivated soon if you don't update your insurance  registration...
﻿Uber IS MY CHOICE!, You work your own hours and you want your figure out your city and meet awesome people and you feel you make a influential difference on the DUI rate!, Some days are slow every job has its days. Making sure your car is clean on the daily regular improves structure independence and maturity!, Still some technical difficulties on maps and I believe the rewards side of the company should blossom further!
﻿So much arrogance aboard the sinking ship, There were a lot of smart motivated people there. Free food., The CEO is a moron. The company has lost close to $2 billion in 2016 thus far and this is after selling off their interests in China. They are going under., You have treated your great talent like crap and most of them have left. What advice can I give?
﻿Smart people there significant culture issues with leadership., Smart people eager to solve problems hard working great business idea. People are willing to work on big challenges and don't give up., Senior leadership does not seem to truly value employees (or drivers). People are viewed as expendable. This will ultimately hurt the business if they don't make changes. Not one cultural value about people., Culture starts at the top- figure out how to get leaders that care about people.
﻿Driving in LA, Can make decent money when there is big events but you have to be very familiar with the area and parking., Rating system sucks. You will get deactivated by Uber if you are rated 4.6 or lower (out of 5). They force you to pick up Uberpool which is very dangerous for you and the passenger most of the time., 
﻿driver, , ,

Too many people from Consulting/Banking *Everyone is overstretched *Work culture can be quite aggressive *You either love the company culture or you hate it. I don't think there's an in-between *Limited developmental opportunities for those based in..., Overall I felt a lot of people were very stressed and not really happy in the long run. I think a good bunch of people just stay for the restricted stock units. Uber should aim at creating a better work climate to incentivise employees to stay. Employees are encouraged to submit a review to Glassdoor during the new employee orientation program in San Francisco. I think that's too early to be able to give a well-rounded...
﻿Honest review, Extreme comfort freedom and flixibility, Up to the point that everything is chaos and non-organized, 
﻿thumbs dumb, There is a ton of flexibility. You can work whenever you want. Also you are your own boss. There is not any micromanagement and you meet many different people. It is a great way to network, It does not pay well and you put a lot of mileage on your car. Driving for uber is very exhausting and you have to deal with a lot of traffic, Have better wages. Provide healthcare. 401 K incentive
﻿Best job I've ever had, Uber is an inspiring mission driven team oriented company to work for. I wake up every day super pumped to go to work., I have no cons at this time., Continue connecting our work to the company values. They help keep us focused.
﻿Great Part Time Gig!, Uber is great for someone who wants to work their own hours is tired of the typical 9-5 job wants flexibility and doesnt mind using their own vehicle. It provides a sense of independence and reliability that you can depend on any time of the year. For a part time job it is second to none when it comes to how easy it is to make money on the side. You can even get paid the same day with Instant Pay whenever you give..., Surge pricing can be hit or miss because you have so many drivers chasing specific areas and most of the time when you get there there's no more request. Also the pay per mile is not great at only about 75 cents a mile. It went down from almost a dollar a mile. This means you have to work twice as long and take longer drives to make any decent money and make it worth it. If the pay was what it was a year ago then it would..., I would advise the development and management team to make it so that surge pricing areas only show to those who are in nearby areas who can get there in 5 minutes or less and not to every driver. I would also advise them to set the pay per mile to at least 95 cents so that more drivers can feel better compensated for their work. This would mean less surging because more drivers would be on the road regularly and customers...
﻿Learned a lot from my time here, The company was still at an early stage so there was a lot of room for me to figure out what I wanted to do within the company and took initiative to be in charge of the role I wanted., Managers had a full plate so you had to figure a lot of stuff out on your own. Not necessarily very organized yet by the time I left the company. Did not compensate contractors well even though we contributed a lot to the company., 
﻿They don't care about the drivers, Nice to be Independent contractor, not enough money for time spent, up your rates
﻿Xchange Leasing - Exciting new company owned by Uber Technologies, My colleagues are all brilliant and hard working; we are building a new operation from the ground up and we are trying to do everything better and with more concern for the customer experience than it has been done in the past., It's a pretty fast-paced place so there is a high expectation in terms of availability responsiveness. Managers do not give a ton of guidance - we are looking for self-starters people who can take projects and run with them., Keep doing what you're doing so that this place doesn't become like a more typical big company with layers of bureaucracy. It's a really exciting place to work now. Maybe streamline the "Perf" process so that we don't have to write so much for each of our peer reviews.
﻿Customer Support, Great benefits and healthcare but pay is below average for the work that you do. You get free lunch and snacks major perk., Diversity issues and the worst attendance policy I ever heard of and the lack of mobility to move up in the company., There is a lack of value for employees at the entry level.
﻿Software Engineer, Free uber riders per month, - Lengthy interview process (recruiters are lazy to reply). - During recruitment you will hear things like we are very flat management  start-up culture we value talent etc. But in practise when you join and if you want to change your team then Its quite the opposite. They really don't care about talent and YOU are just another use and throw resource for the company - Fake career promises - Recruiters as well as..., 
﻿uber, Concept is great pay is pathetic, no compensation for expenses. too easy to get removed., lower your fees on drivers
﻿Driver, Great money and easy to start working-all done online make own hours, Mostly intoxicated people and your vehicle gets damaged on the inside., Don't take so much of the drivers' fares allow riders to put a tip on their card using the app don't take someone off the road due to angry intoxicated people who write things for no reason and are not truthful. Drivers make UBER money give them a chance to give their side.
﻿Crazy unending hours for little pay, Doing very tangible real work. Smart people. Large amount of responsibility., Hours were crazy and never ending for very low salaries. On-call 247. Disorganized and inconsistent middle management. Aggressive culture where people tried to take each other out to get ahead., Get rid of the inexperienced people managing very large businesses. They dont know what they are doing.
﻿Great Vision - Inspirational - Lack of "Qualified Managment", If you're a millennial Uber is the place for you...The potential for growth is exponential. Find a mentor and visionary that will help guide you through process. There are many available within cross functional teams. Its about knowing who is supportive and who has their own agenda. (Be aware of the frauds who are who are hiding behind their lack of management skills and use your efforts for their own success). ..., I found that the managers within certain HQ teams encouraged and supported a "Mean Girl" management style within the team. If you don't go along with them they'll do "what ever is in their power" as a group and individually to isolate and control. Senior Management is fully aware and looks the other way. The leadership is responsible for the lack of action. HR - placates the initial concern but ultimately back the..., It's one thing to say to a dedicated employee "I'm here for you" it's another thing to "actually listen" and not reward bad untrained mangers with a pat on the back and say keep up the good work. HR - Needs to have a more proactive approach at analyzing employee concerns. Sometimes there is something to what is occurring that requires more attention.
﻿Uber Expert, Flexible hours friendly team fun work space, The job is about maximizing efficiency in the shortest amount of time. You start to feel like a robot., 
﻿Fantastic Team and Amazing Opportunities for Growth, New and unique work that is unprecedented., Pace can be challenging but that is also what can create some of the most rewarding opportunities., 
﻿Hard to Imagine A More Unpleasant Place to Work, - Work with some very brilliant people. - Opportunity to learn a lot about software design data analytics marketing biz dev etc. - Center of attention at cocktail parties since you are working at the hottest company in the world., - Ultra-aggressive deadlines cumbersome processes and huge workload. - Daily firing (stack ranking and constantly letting "bottom performers" go) - Terrible place for new grads as there are no grace periods to ramp up or learn. Many let go after just two months. - Offers no longer competitive with many established companies when one considers the misleading nature of the preferred share prices. - Incredible amounts..., - Growth hides all problems but once things slow down or company goes IPO there will be a mass exodus. - Majority of leadership are clueless especially many of the middle managers.
﻿UberX Driver, Flexibility pay human interaction enjoyable great 2nd job, no taxes taken out at the mercy of demand use your own car, Keep up the good work and offer more incentives for drivers
﻿Easy to move up, Everyone is open to change trying new things plus free lunch and snacks!, Growth pattern can be unclear for transitioning from contractor to full time employee at times., 
﻿UberEats, Work when you want no boss to answer to. Listen to your music drive at your leisure. Can't think of much else., The pay rates for food deliveries are awful. Did it for 3 nights during dinner time in a busy area. Everyone expects you to bring the food to their door in giant apartment complexes and high rises when you're making $4.xx for that delivery. Worked a total of 16 hours drove 300 miles and made $130 after my gas cost I was at $90. Only two people out of 20-30 tipped me for a total of $5 in tips. Uber tells customers..., Encourage tipping and up the rates. It's a slap in the face when you take such a high cut and leave your drivers high and dry--they're your bread and butter and soon it will be known how little the pay is.
﻿Misleading, Set your own schedule and hours, Destroys your vehicle Can be "deactivated" anytime for any reason Your schedule and money depends on when the people move Independent Contractor (1099) Taxes, Listen to your employees I mean your contractors

﻿Not Worth It, If you end up in the right place there's latitude to work on pretty far-ranging projects and you if really end up in the right place they won't be rush jobs. New engineering leadership seems to have a solid vision. There are some very impressive people here though it's telling that I'd describe none of them as matching the dominant demographics or culture here., Uber is constitutionally incapable of being a high-quality software outfit. As an organization it's addicted to shipping and the recent push to increase software reliability is doomed to failure in the face of the fact that the people tasked with implementing it are either 1) the aforementioned SHIP IT junkies or 2) hastily-hired junior developers (you get to learning their names pretty quick when you correlate them..., Get real about the pockets of regressive thinking that are holding the engineering org back. The director-level leadership has good ideas but they're not willing to get their hands dirty in terms of getting their reports in line and things are festering on the IC level. Release diversity numbers it's far more pathetic-looking to hide them than to just admit that they're awful but I guess then you'd have to put at...

﻿Great Place to Work!, Great perks awesome co-workers inspiring mission, Uber is all about hustle and scrappiness -- sometimes it can be overwhelming!, 
﻿UberX Driver, Meeting people from all over the world. Having deep conversations with people I just met., Obnoxious drunk passengers are sometimes rude. They think they own the car they are riding in., Improve the GPS to improve pickup and dropoff locations. Google Maps is much more accurate than the Uber GPS.
﻿quality of service, great care and attention for employees alot of perks, the drivers are the last to eat in the chain, Drivers are the blood of your business show them love and care
﻿Driver..part time, Only one flexibility in your work hours, They are the dirtiest lowdown manipulative disrespectful company I have ever encountered in twenty years. They try to send you ten or more miles or of your way and if you refuse they deactivate you and threaten you. They need people to drive in the dangerous west valley and tried to force me to I refused., The foundation of your company is your drivers. When you continue to mistreat your driversfor foundation will crumble.
﻿Disappointing, You can make your own hours! Meet new people! Travel and learn about new places that you've never been before., Cut rates no tips customer service is lacking gps is not the best customers can be rude and complain to uber and uber doesn't ask they just take the customers side., Please look into better customer service and give rates that drivers can actually work on.
﻿The most sexist culture in engineering within silicon valley tech, + good brand + fast paced and lots to learn, - management in engineering is sexist - force the female in bottom of performance bcos of bias - HR is blind to all this, wake up and start improving the culture else you will never be able to build a company with diverse workforce
﻿Uber Driver, I've been driving for Uber since the end of the school year. The pros to this job is you can work whatever and as many hours as you'd like. Some of the perks are okay like 10 cents off per gallon of gas but it's not huge. Uber is very fast to resolve issues. You CAN make up to $20 an hour as a regular uber driver but typically you don't. It's great side money., Driving in the sun/rush hour is very exhausting. UberPool is less money and more time. Even if you pick up multiple riders you still don't make as much money as UberX. You don't always get to the price surges. You make very little money after gas car maintenance (oil tires rotations cleaning etc). Uber takes notice if you don't accept rides. Riders ask to go shopping while you wait and you only make $0.12..., The support staff is very fast to resolve problems. The app needs a park feature to increase net income for drivers so they're not making $2.40 for someone to grocery shop for 20 minutes even though they said 2 minutes. Great company otherwise.
﻿Could be much better, Uber is an extremely frustrating place to work (The honeymoon period wears off pretty quickly). The company has the money and the brand to attract the best in terms of engineering but for whatever reason the product and engineering orgs leave so much to be desired (and I am not even in engineering!) All too frequently it seems the company runs into painful outages bugs broken tools etc that negatively impacts employees..., Fix the engineering org. Get rid of under performers including engineering executives that are ultimately responsible for building an outage-prone org that has too frequently negatively impacted the entire company., 
﻿Toe-stepping entitled millennial brats in a bureaucratic & stressful workplace, Free Uber credit free breakfast and lunch...and dinner (but at 8:30 pm) If you play the right game you can move up the ladder - Manager within 2.5 years Unlimited PTO (but nobody really does this without taking their laptop with them), Unqualified leads and managers lacking work experience management ability & emotional intelligence Low base salary Cold & stressful work environment Long hours - if you leave before 6pm don't even think about it No diversity focus No respect for employees with families to go home to People are extremely unhappy fearful & undervalued, 
﻿You lose a ton of your own resources, Work on your own time and steady money. Get to drive if you love driving. Get to know customers if you're sociable. Sometimes the riders give out tips. You tend to make more money if you live in suburbs especially rich ones Great extra money and part time job., Spend an excessive amount of money on gas ($100+ weekly) maintenance terrible riders who deface and suspect your car they take 20% off of your rides and other fees riders try to drink in your car and play with my smartphone while I'm driving riders tell you nothing about the point and point b so drivers don't know what it is if it's a building or residence so they reprimand you. The corporate better put in more fields..., Just because you have $70+ billion already doesn't mean you can't improve drastically. There's a ton to improve on. Having drivers pay for EVERYTHING - car gas etc. is bizarre. The riders are getting all the breaks not the drivers. The drivers are the ones doing all the work and get Uber customers. The customers just hail them.
﻿It was completely amazing. Good learning experience., Flexible working hours. Informal dress code. Lots of freebies. Free lunch. UBER swag. Awesome learning experience. Best for college sophomores.On-demands experience is amazing, Long working hours. You have to interact with drivers and convince them to work for uber. Tedious task of engaging new users., Plan some good activities.
﻿Ratings Of Drivers Should Not Be On Display for Riders, Can pick hours you want to work, You are at the mercy of grumpy riders who - no matter how hard you want to please them - you can't., When riders rate drivers - they can hurt their career. One person rates poorly and then sets off a domino effect because the next person to come along will think they should rate poorly as well. I do a really good job taking care of customers and I don't need an elementary school star rating to know that I do a good job.
﻿Just A Reminder: Drivers Are Still People, - Excellent secondary or tertiary (but NOT primary) income. -Flexible hours and time off whenever you want., - No benefits whatsoever; - No regular pay whatsoever; - Incessant cuts to already bargain-basement compensation that barely covers expenses on some days (between November 2015 and January 2016 per-mile compensation fell 48% and per-minute rate fell 52%); - No reimbursement for mandatory expenses; - Poorly implemented features that allow unscrupulous riders to abuse the system and get back door discounts at..., We know that your end game is to have a fleet of self-driving cars. Problem is you're so excited to have robot drivers that you've forgotten to wait until you actually have them to completely disregard the needs and wellbeing of the human drivers who are still conducting all of your operations. Stop that.
﻿Fast way to ean money...., Meeting new people getting to know cities fast way of earning money, Uber tech service is awful...., 
﻿Scam, schedule flexibility. I can't think of anything else., The rating system has many flaws for the drivers end. They require you to note tolls and add them each time you cross a toll. Didn't realize this till I stopped working for them and ended up paying all my tolls., What's the point. They don't care nor do they even pretend to listen.

﻿No room for growth, Good compensation and benefits., They are more focused on the structure of the team than the growth of the actual employees. Lots of turnover and shifting which makes it hard to build a career. Fear-based management on certain teams., Ensure that employees have the opportunity to grow and seek challenges. People will leave if you are too focused on structure and rigidity.
﻿It is what it is, Make your own Hours Meeting new people, Money really is not reliable or substantial Wear on Vehicle Drunk/ Unpleasant people, 
﻿Sketchy but pays the bills, Uber is SUPER busy in San Francisco. Thats how most people get around. The people are usually nice to ride with. Most are awkward and don't talk. Hourly guarantees ride incentives up to 500 bucks a week., Uber almost always tries to skimp out on the hourly guarantees. Totally not GUARANTEED. They take 25% commission on everything including tolls. NOBODY TIPS. Uber marketed to the riders it was included in the fare buy its definitely not. Other Uber drivers are rude foreign speaking AND unqualified to drive., Don't try to get out of paying people their money. Raise the rates and have a stricter hiring process.

﻿Experts at Uber, Day to day interactions with Driver-Partners and quick solutions to their queries. Helping them on-board on the platform. Remote solutions too. This internship adds a brand to your Resume., Not a full-time role. Outsourced via KlausIT solutions Bangalore. Your role duration is based on the requirement and opening. Hence no perks too., 
﻿Great Environment, The environment is laid back and not stressful, Management lacks skills of coordination., Better planning through Systems Operations Management is necessary.
﻿IRT CSR at Uber, Constantly changing workplace great management plenty of opportunity. Really great benefits., leadership could be better. Do not feel connected to "Corporate Uber"., 
﻿Driver, Schedule your own time frame Be Your Own Boss the idea is not bad who doesn't want to work for themselves, They don't pay you nowhere near enough whatever they say you make per hour is BS because they calculate different by different I mean it's not accurate, Pay your employees more take less of a chunk out of the rate or higher the rate for rides the money is kind of a joke
﻿Part time at Uber, the job was rather easy and straightforward very friendly coworkers and employers. part time working hours were quite flexible. sometimes you are given credit as bonus to use the app., the hourly pay became less as the company grew. Working locations switched often depending on whether there is an event or street promotion needed. If you'd like a stable working location then please beware, be consistent with the Salary. when you start high and go lower even though the company is growing employees may lose their motivation

Time-off policy sounds great in theory ("work hard take time when you need it") but in practice no one can actually take time off because the entire company is so fast-paced. A single day off least to 100+ unanswered emails potentially missing important meetings being unavailable if something goes down etc. Any who takes any vacation time does so with the knowledge that they'll..., Promote a better work-life balance. The time-off policy seems generous until you understand that it comes with a caveat of still being expected to work even when you're not in the office. Encouraging employees to take real weekends and days off (and not sit on Hipchat at midnight on Friday night because they're still working) needs to come from the top down.

Called at 8:30 pm to say don't come to work the next day. Was given no reason for termination since it was at-will. They're in the clear legally but definitely an unprofessional way of terminating someone. - Not a great work life balance. People needed to stay till 7 or 8pm at work to get their stuff done., - Fire people in a more professional way (do it in person and give a reason). Having been given absolutely no reason for termination and given the fact that the managers kept talking about how they need to hire more people and also given my great weekly performance evaluations and great reviews by teammates I am left wondering what the reason exactly was and if it was even a legitimate reason.

﻿Uber review, , , 
﻿Perfect balance of startup energy & structure from scale, I came from the startup world and was looking for a more mature organization that still had the entrepreneurial energy. Uber is that company. The values that Uber instills in its employees are geared toward empowering you to make an impact and move things forward. While I don't feel like I'm lacking resources I tend towards a scrappy means to make things happen. It's rare to have the opportunity to operate on the scale..., Everyone will offer you their opinion when you start working at Uber. And while it's one of the more competitive places to land a job it has a notable reputation in Silicon Valley. I don't see this as a con but it's important that you believe in the mission of Uber. Everyone at Uber is excited to make Uber as reliable as running water (for everyone) but if you aren't 100% excited by that mission it's not the right..., Continue to be transparent with employees! Uber does a great job of this currently and I feel very in sync with what is happening on the strategic and tactical levels.
﻿Not What It's Cracked Up to Be, Make your own hours. Drive your own car. Meet people., If you're looking to become a driver for Uber there are some things you need to know before you invest the time and money. 1) There are already far too many drivers in most cities in which Uber operates. Your income will not be what you think it will be because there are too many drivers and not enough demand. 2) You will spend at least 50% of what you earn on gasoline proper insurance and vehicle wear. 3)..., For the love of everything good in the world STOP TAKING ON NEW DRIVERS.

﻿Drive at your own risk, flexible schedule work as much or as little as you want., terrible driver support service.

﻿Driver, You can do it anytime you like flexible hours and a good job to rely on for the moment!, You have to put a lot of hours.

Low Pay.Prides on the no tipping policy. No delivery boundaries- Driver could be 50 miles from home if not careful.

Some restaurants have a long wait time. If you call to check if the order is ready they..., Be more considerate to your drivers...Pay better and be reachable on the phone. After all if we don't drive you are out of business.
﻿Inspiring, Working at Uber is inspiring. Seeing how the company is truly making transportation as reliable as running water for everyone and everywhere makes going into work each day great., Not a 9 to 5 job prepare yourself that each day will present challenges that have to be addressed outside of "normal" working hours., 
﻿Awesome Company, At Uber we are able to work with brilliant people and also we have the chance to improve the way people move around the cities. Been a part of that amazing company is a pleasure. The idea of been able to take care of big projects on the first few weeks is a great push for our carriers., There are no cons so far. Everything is great., Keep on doing the great work you are doing.
﻿4 months in and loving it!, Great team work and prospects for individual growth. Team members are all highly competent go-getters! Plenty of inter- and intra- department support. The dynamic business model and environment motivates employees to keep best business practices and forward-thinking behaviour., Not suitable for persons who struggle with dealing with stress and change. There is no spoon feeding each person needs to take initiative to improve their respective functions and processes.,

﻿Saturated, Paid weekly no boss listen to your music and stop working when you want sometimes the passengers offer to buy you drinks and food, Too many drivers are recruited so there's less work when school is out of session. People getting sick in your vehicle a huge possibility also no tip integrated into the system. Weeeaaakkkk, Take care of your drivers especially the ones with 500+ hours give them more incentives. Especially in the summer when business is rough
﻿Best job I've ever had!, Some of the best reasons to work for Uber are the never ending opportunities for growth and development. I learn something new every single day I go to work and with that my professional development has taken an unexpected and exciting detour. Uber supports its employees and believes in innovation and autonomous work environments., Here are 5 words because I can't think of a reason not to work for Uber.,

Those are the only good things., When you sign up they tell you that you will be paid $6.65 base + just under $2 (I believe it was $1.85) per km. What they don't explain to you is that the base isn't per hour it's per trip and UBER takes 35% of that base and 35% of the km you ride for.

However it would be hard to keep it this exciting on a 9-5 schedule., Keep doing what you're doing!
﻿Uber driver, Flexible schedule. Work when you want., You spend a lot of money to make money. Figure at least $25 per day in gas cost of tolltag debits from your account increased insurance cost for commercial insurance and if you lease a vehicle from Uber the money left after deductions is pathetic.

I'm sure if I was still a driver and they saw what I posted I'd be deactivated. I wish I had enough space to explain my whole situation but I..., My advice would be to treat your drivers better before you run out of them. If you think about it us drivers are the ones making money for your company. We pay for the gas insurance and maintance. You pay absoluity nothing and treat us like crap! If there was a legit reason for my deactivation then I would admit it but there isn't. Even the Uber guy I talked to said it doesn't make sense! From reading through the reviews...

This would allow a driver to put in a location and pick up fares going the direction of the destination filtered. 4.. The incentives are B.S. and they always..., Class action suit coming your way! Count on it., 
﻿Concerned, Coworkers are great some very inspiring people walking the halls. Lot's of nice collaboration. Folks really care about the company. I still truly believe in the mission with everything I have., In the last 6-9 months the executive engineering leadership hiring has been really worrying. Lot's of bullying and scatterbrained direction. Reviews are a total blackbox - most times your manager doesn't even know why you got the rating you did. People are scared like I've never seen before., We used to solve problems and develop solutions. Now everybody is hiding from the bully. I'm sure you don't see the negative effects yet - but keep your eyes open.
﻿Community Operation Specialist, Uber Cool life working in Next Technology Gaint. Fastest Growing Company., To be Frank Didn't discovered yet., 
﻿Worst support in history, Choose your own hours decent money. Enjoyable job. Convenient once everything is working., They keep making it cheaper for the rider and raised the percentage they take. Screwing the driver. Not worth depreciation of vehicle. Support is TERRIBLE, Get a better support system. It's ridiculous the support goes in circles with each response because you never talk to the same person twice so nothing gets answered. Also its almost as though support doesn't read the question at all and copy and paste useless information each response.
﻿Uber Misconceptions, Flexible times you work when you want to work., Horrible horrible horrible technology. The system is not for the driver. No opportunities. You spent more out then you make. Don't leave your full-time job, None

﻿Uber Partner Driver, Work at your convenience; self-employed; have met some terrific people and have seen some neighborhoods/areas that I likely would not have stumbled on, I signed up specifically because of the RNC. Airport fares are a joke - wait times are 30 to 60 minutes just to get a passenger. Don't know if it's true but I heard that Uber brought in other drivers from surrounding markets; worked for 5 hours today; spent most of the time waiting; made $50. Given MPG wasted time waiting etc. that equals $10 per hour but MINUS gas wear and tear on the vehicle. If you have an Uber..., If it is in fact true that Uber brought in drivers from other markets to cover an event - shame on you - the company clearly made money but it's current local driver base did not - we spent more time waiting for passengers than actually on the road driving :-(
﻿Customer Service Rep, The atmosphere is very fun and fast paced everyone is friendly fairly flexible with schedule and vacation benefits are excellent Uber credit is a plus!, Uber can provide a very fast pace work environment constant updates communication timing can vary training for positions can take time., Keep it up we understand it is a super fast growing company lock down the trainings and get some steady policy streamlined.

Don't fully eliminate human drivers for self-driving cars/automation.
﻿Terrible., It's nice to be able to set your own hours. You do me a lot of interesting people when you're driving., There are some days I work for 6 hours and I'll lose money. I have to travel 15 minutes to pick up a rider who rides for 5 minutes for the minimum fare. The rider things that we get more than we do because of the booking fees and then the additional 25% that over takes away. You're going to put a ton of miles on your vehicle but you won't really feel like you accounted for when you looked at how much you made. Then when..., Decrease her commission if you're going to charge a booking fee. You're going to make money regardless but when you make it so your drivers are sad when they see how much they get paid vs. How much it cost you're not going to have happy drivers.

I've seen ads where Uber claims you can make $35.00 an hour. That's total b.s. Also they have this heat map that supposedly shows you where high demand is and the fair will be higher. TOTAL joke.

There's no guarantee that you'll get a steady flow of rides because the market it still so small in ATL. No perks or bonuses like Lyft (which has an even smaller market here in GA)., Give awards to diligent drivers who maintain their 4.5 ratings or who drive full-time.

You are working in a very interesting problem space and you are also surrounded by some really smart people. Also a lot of people here have prior experience at other top tech companies in the area so it's great to bring the best practices from each of those companies together., Coming from a string of smaller companies it's a bit of overhead learning how to navigate a big company and finding the right person to ask questions to. Things move very fast here so it may feel less structured at times. The food isn't as high quality as at other tech companies but still decent. And there's lots of snacks., Keep up the good work.

﻿Uber not ALL bad, Good way to get a car if you don't qualify for financing. You can pay your bills and live off the money but you have to put in the time and know when and where to drive., They constantly lower the prices to draw more customers then tell you the driver that you can make the same money per week but you'll just have to drive twice as many trips., Add a tip function to the app already EVERY competitor has one.
﻿High Learning Curve, You learn so much starting day one and continue this sprint of continuing to learn throughout your time at Uber. Uber is a global company so your coworkers are just those that are sitting next to you but also all over the world cross-learning is a huge forté.

﻿Uber Driver, Independent Contracting allows for personal set hours from minimal work to full maximum., More leverage needed for Uber contractors and more percentage should be given to them as well., 
﻿Challenging work environment, People are intelligent. You can definitely see the growth and potential in the company. The people that succeed here are incredibly passionate about Uber and are willing to sacrifice a lot of their personal life for the success of the company., Unclear career progression. Poor and inconstant management. A lot of strong personalities who are unwilling to compromise. Poor communication -- a lot of people unknowingly (and knowingly) replicate work. Everyone acts like this is a startup and like their work is in a silo which is really frustrating. Although the company claims to promote transparency I have experienced a lot of the opposite. Not enough emphasis..., Promote a culture of wellness and more work-life balance among your employees. There is a culture of "redlining" and burnout that's not sustainable.
﻿Prepare Yourself, It's like drinking from a fire hose but in a good way. When you see the scale at which this company is and is planning to change this industry it is a little overwhelming., Because of the amazing growth and market change as the market adapts to Uber'scbusiness model things are in constant flux. You need to be prepared to change gears and priorities but not lose your passion if you are a routine oriented person this company might not be for you., I think they are doing well considering the growth. Communication isn't the best but that gets really hard with this kind of growth and market strategy adjustment.

﻿Changing the way the world moves, 1. Super-smart and superpumped people 2. Always make big and bold bets 3. Tackling a tangible real-world problem that has the potential to change the world as it stands currently 4. Steep learning curve and great growth opportunities, 1) Not for people who like to take it easy (my way of saying that while the work-life balance is great for me personally not everyone may be cut out for it) 2) Organization in constant flux which means that there are a lot of moving pieces to navigate, Keep at it.

﻿Uber review, Weekly pay direct deposit same day cash outs 9.9 of the riders are terrific. 80/20 split if the fares and guarantee hours of peak hours, Rating system that has no accountability for the riders the riders should make a comment for a low rating about the drivers. Being curse at by drunk drivers. You can report them., more of a split when work over 40 hours maybe a 90/10 split would be great
﻿Career path to nowhere, When I started I was ecstatic about working for such a prominent company such as Uber. I came in ready to dedicate day and night to the company. I helped launch the UberEATS marketplace platform in the Seattle area and was excited to be apart of something great. You get free lunches wide assortment of food in the kitchen and flexibility in work hours., - Pick favorites: I was hired alongside two individuals who helped with the whole process of launch the UberEATs market platform. Two of us would slave away and do all the hard work while other person gets new tasks and able to take on new roles. - Treat you life DIRT: Management and everyone puts on a facade by boosting morale yet they do things such as fire you in a moments notice with no reasoning as to why.

﻿amazing place to work, Disruptive dynamic smart open friendly diverse., Long hours hard to book meeting rooms, keep it going guys!
﻿Great people!, Get paid for every ride make your own schedule and are able to take days off when needed. Freely up to you to work as much or little as you'd like., Some work days can be slow. The days that you decide to work and you want to make more money than normal sometimes aren't as busy as expected., Marketing for app in all cities
﻿Its okay, The goo thing about this job is that you can work when ever time you want. I did this job as a student and it worked out for me., The payment if really not that much unless you are giving long rides. At times you would would make as low as $2 with in one fare., I think management souls consider adding a tip feature to the app. we are advised not to take cash but it would be nice to make a little more extra from this.
﻿Part time uber driver- they don't pay enough!, It allows you to have a flexible schedule, They take too high of a percentage don't pay enough and they don't consider all the time you spend driving in traffic. Only mileage!, Think about the drivers more ! Pay better.
﻿Decent short term no future., Uber is a decent way to get yourself out of a hole. Being behind on bills between jobs etc. Only worth your time of you've already got a qualifying vehicle and will pass a background and credit check., The pay is all over the map. Both the fare price per mile which uber changes at will and whether you'll get a decent number of calls and how much those calls will pay. I've made $25 an hour only to make $0 for the next two hours., I think uber corporate is still trying to find a balance between the cheapest the drivers were work for and the most the drivers will pay. I don't think they're doing a bad job but it's much better for riders than drivers.
﻿ehhh??, work when you want interesting to meet different people, pay isnt that good doesnt even work out to min wage BEFORE gas thats putting in 7-1o hrs day so far NO XL rides. and i cant work bar scene, 
﻿Not at all a profitable proposition., At the current rate per mile there are no benefits. But since I have a 20 word minimum I will repeat they have no benefits., Major insurance companies do not provide drivers with insurance if they work for Uber which means that Uber will not represent you in litigation and that your insurance company will not represent you. Therefore you will have to come out of pocket to pay for your own lawyer and both parties will look to put the blame on you., Not worth my time.
﻿Driver, Schedule Flexibility. Paid weekly on Thursday for previous week. Work wherever you want. Use your own car and have weekend riders puke inside., UBER is the king of NO-TIP culture. UBER actively markets itself as cashless transaction and discourages riders from tipping. Wear and tear on personal vehicle. Insurance is expensive for rideshare plans. Price drops are a regular occurance. After doing it for a while you WILL realize you are NOT making any money. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL !!!!!!, They don't listen to or care at all about their drivers or drivers complaints. Over the course of the time that I drove ride prices dropped at least 3 times. They continue to refuse to add tip button the the UBER app. Other ride share services have adding tipping to their app's. They are just biding time until driverless cars become a reality and then they won't have to pay drivers at all.
﻿It is a great job with flexible, They have very flexible hours and consistent business. The company pays you weekly and you can see how much you have made right after the trip is complete., Depreciation on own your own vehicle adds up.

Uber has some smart people working for them the hustle the growth is amazing., Flexible time off - More lateral moves as opposed to upward advancements. Because Uber has such amazing people it is going to be hard to retain them as the wages are not reflective of the change of lateral positions and duties assigned., I can not stress enough to make sure that promote from within as these are your best and brightest that hired/contracted to do these amazing things. Employee engagement such as peer recognition is good however as employees are gaining invaluable experience you might see talent leaving and the recognition may not be enough to keep them.

﻿Ubering, - Self Employed - Own Schedule - Paid Every Week - Meeting New Pople - Surge Pricing Over all great experience if you know what you are doing., - Horrible Rating System - No Tips - Little recognition from the company - Passengers that don't know how to use the app. - Passengers that are under the effect of alcohol (can be a huge problem), Love to work for Uber is a fast growing company but they need to educate more passengers and drivers. More work ethics and definitely take care of the most reliable and unconditional drivers that really take seriously the job.
﻿Driving for Uber, It gives you opportunity to choose your schedule & Independency You meet new people., -On the average Uber driver makes around $10 an hour before you make deductibles for gas cellphone data insurance and motor vehicle wear and tear. It is really frustrating and I don't think I can invite anybody into this. -Your bills won't get paid., There should be a minimum rider's charge that is reasonable say $5 regardless of commute distance. This way the drivers will be encouraged. -Give preference to your drivers because without them there will be no Uber. The compensation is very poor. The passengers pay so less and so they love to ride Uber. Imagine you getting paid $3.28 for picking and dropping off a passenger and $2.28 for another. What kind of compensation...

You get to know your town really well., *Even on weekend nights you'll be lucky to make minimum wage. *The app tells riders they don't have to tip so no one does. *Riders frequently drop their pin in the wrong location and then don't answer their phones when you try to find out where they really are. Or are too drunk to tell you. Or cancel at the last minute after you've driven a long way to go get them. All of these situations are a huge waste of gas and..., You've got to find a way to make this profitable for drivers. The job is mostly fun and the flexibility is fantastic but there are nights when I don't even cover my expenses. Week nights there aren't enough rides and fares are crazy low. Weekend nights there are so many drivers you don't get enough rides. And this is even when "surge" prices are in effect. How does that make sense? Please please let riders know...
﻿Fine if you like working for nothing, Flexible schedules some passengers are actually enjoyable., Pay is horrible. If there's no surge you literally make nothing. You make about $10 an hour to drive your own car. Mainly drunk passengers that will spill drinks in your car and offer no apology or tip., Focus are marketing to passengers and not drivers. There are too many drivers and not enough passengers.
﻿For yourself without the hassle..., Amazing hours and versatility as a full-time or part-time employment opportunity. Company works very well for any safe and reliable driver to gain some extra income or even maximize a full-time schedule. Easy process to apply and begin earning money right away. Also as a customer of Uber you can appreciate both the give and take relationship of this company., Recommend smart budgeting when gaining employment at Uber due to the lack of tax withholding throughout the year. Lack of withholdings can leave an unexperienced employee/budgeter out to dry come tax season., Great offers for car buying assistance and absolute versatility however options for new employees to obtain financial guidance or Uber income methodology training would be beneficial in the long run for employee sustainment.

They've cut our per-trip bonuses for the third time this spring this time as an incentive to get more couriers on the road before noon (Just like the drivers we're working more and more and more just to try to maintain the same amount of pay as before.) There's no incentive to go the extra mile (literally) for a customer when the next pay cut's literally always around the corner. With the lack..., Value the people you have instead of finding ways to get more work out of us for the same amount of money or less. As couriers we're literally ambassadors for UberRush and UberEATS. Why not reward longevity with higher bonuses or higher per-trip amounts?
﻿Terrible Company to work for, Flexibility and Freedom to drive when you want, Don't make any money Passengers are dumb and told not to tip Wear and tear on your car, Start listening to the drivers - without good ones your company will fail.
﻿Uber Partner's policy of only emailing for inquiries might be the worst service I have ever experienced, Asa a "partner" If you have an issue you are better off finding a solution on google or figuring it out yourself than emailing their Partners email address. I have been driving for almost a year now and unless I have 0 problems everything is fine. However if you have an issue that needs resolved you're kind of screwed! The ONLY way to speak with an Uber Rep besides going into their office is to email their Partners..., Keep it up screwing over you drivers with simple issues.. doing a great job at that!,

﻿Ehhh, Uber is special in that you can do it on your own time. It is great for a side job and depending on your area can be good full-time gig., - no phone number to contact for support - many responses from team are just copied answers from FAQ not explanatory even when specific questions are asked - I had a hard time applying for Uber and customer service was terrible in solving the issues I was experiencing -Very pro rider. and Very pro Uber. Not at all pro-Driver! I would like to see a more pro driver rate initiated. Perhaps adding 35 cents per mile..., I would like to see a more pro driver rate initiated. Perhaps adding 35 cents per mile driven for gas bonus that is added after a driver makes a certain amount of trips or goes a certain number of miles. Something small like this will make Uber a bit more Driver friendly and will likely help with driver retention.

Uber is making an impact on a global scale and I definitely feel like even though I am in an entry-level position that my feedback matters and I help improve processes to further improve Uber. I have already seen changes I have suggested be put into place! Lastly and most importantly I love having a positive impact on the people..., A majority don't realize Uber is still very new. Things are always evolving and improving because they need to be internally and externally. Sometimes it feels like things can move a little too fast. But the biggest frustration is hearing Anti-Uber articles because it really does seem very biased and no one likes hearing something they love or believe in get put down and not seen for the wonderful thing that it is., I honestly don't have any advice here. All the management that I have interacted with have been super willing to listen to feedback and make you feel valued.
﻿Payment is way too small..., Your own time work. You can work any day any time for "quick" cash ... but the payment is miserable because you have to cover for your gas plus 20% uber takes from the fare you earn each trip; so about 50% of the earning is just to be able to operate., Payment is sad and you have to cover for your own gas. 5 Trips (about 3 hours) I got about 50 dollars for about half a tank. I fill my tank with 30 dollars so my income is about 70 dollars 6 hours of work give or take..., Pay more!
﻿Your own hours, I really enjoyed being able to make my own hoursit was quite convenient., Sometimes I would drive for 8 hrs and not even make 100.00 .Uber lowered the fair for its customers which in turn lowered our pay., 
﻿Awesome unique experience, I came to Uber concerned about rumors I had heard about a cutthroat culture. I needn't have worried. Uber is one of the most collaborative environments I have ever worked in. Whether its answering a question about their code helping to debug or working together on a feature people have been uniformly enthusiastic about helping their co-workers. Perhaps this is because everyone's stock grants are so large that people..., Work life balance suffers a bit in this environment. Don't come here to go on cruise control. Uber demands hard work from everyone and consistent 8-hr days are rare., 
﻿NYC employee, I am more challenged here than anywhere else I've ever worked I am growing at a rate that is probably not possibly at most other firms. It's incredibly exciting to work for such a fast moving company that is doing truly innovative and boundary pushing work. The office hours are totally reasonable despite what is found here on Glassdoor. Results matter (almost to a fault) face time is meaningless. I think..., The stress that comes from such high expectations. Everyone I work with seems to always be stressed and worried about their performance I had to take a fairly decent hit in salary to come here but that's the flip side of lots of equity in a massively growing firm., Be more kind to employees. Don't be so 100% focused on results. Even strong performers will lave if they are always stressed and worried about their job security.
﻿Amazing opportunity to build something at my level, This company is something that if you are not part of you can't understand how you feel proud of what you've made and achieve in less than 6 months. I gladly took the opportunity of setting up the consumer PR strategy in Paris and build something from zero and I enjoy it everyday., Everything goes fast so you have to be part of it and take the train of the innovation., 
﻿Engineering Manager, Freedom to design my role as best I see fit along with the resources to hit our goals. The strong belief in principled action no matter what fickle winds may be blowing., Work / Life is all work unless you're quite intentional about guarding and scheduling 'life', Keep up the pursuit of principle-driven action. Find ways to help us hustle while visibly sponsoring a healthy work/life balance for the long haul.
﻿A great job fit for a student, Work when you want to. They pay weekly and automatically., Sometimes there are no riders., 
﻿Internship Experience, The freedom to test out whatever you want is what uber gives you., The only cons is you not coming up with ideas to implement, None

﻿Uber Driver, Set your own hours can be profitable in busy surging areas you can stay busy, With no surge pricing your effectively just getting a payday loan from you car., 
﻿Do Not Work for Uber Drivers are scammed, You get to Choose your own hours And Learn Seattle geography And Meet interesting people, You receive Extremely low pay And Put up with a horrible Dishonest company culture that promotes itself in a shining light. Drivers use their own resources without proper compensation., Stop scamming drivers and get start promoting a supportive culture that enable people especially drivers to actually make a decent living. You Behave like loan sharks.
﻿A worthwhile experience, There's never a dull moment in this fast paced environment. If you are a fan of innovation and can handle unexpected change this is the place for you. Be prepared to pull up your boot straps and dig in., At times the atmosphere is quite competitive although the company preaches togetherness. That same competitive nature can make for a toxic environment when based on merit that is proven by boasting and not actual ability or accomplishment. Work/ life balance is almost nonexistent which can lead to high stress levels., Employees work very hard at this company. I'd advise managers to somehow better promote work/ life balance.
﻿Ethically immoral, Staff is hungry and energetic. New realm of possibilities. Not to many pros besides those. Sorry GlassDoor. Hard to make this part at least 20 words., Where to start. At the beginning the passion was dripping from every corner because of the idea that this company was trying to fix a broken system (transportation logistics). That lasted a couple of months. Uber is in all purposes smoke and mirrors. For example all these posts that your reading. Guess what they are all lies. Uber created them. How do I know? That was our job to manufacture fake reviews. We had..., Please do yourself a favor make these drivers employees. Stop creating a hostile work environment in the office. Competion is great but this isn't warfare. Its business. Cool out on the dramatics. You guys act like a soap opera.
﻿The IT job that is always changing, Technology driven organization with great leaders., At times the growth oust the procedures., Always respect the employees and public
﻿Great company with vision and passion, It is a real global company that try to implement this app portal around the world. All the teams work together and seek for solutions and they work on this not just because it is their job duty but they are all passionate to make the world moving. We all believed in this company can provide another opportunity for the drivers to earn extra money at the same time the riders can benefit on the it., This is a super busy company that sometimes it moves faster that all we can think of so you may need to prepare to stay a bit longer to catch up on all the meeting and follow up with all the related parties., Good to see this company keep growing and I think we may need to thinking about the work life balance later on.
﻿Uber Driver Pros & Cons, - Ultimate flexibility - No boss overseeing - Meeting new people, - No tips - An ineffective rating system - Wear and tear on car, 
﻿About as flexible a job as you can get, Responsible for all vehicle maintenance, Add an option for the rider to add a tip through the app, 
﻿Uber experience, Set your own hours and thats about it., Doesn't allow tipping like lyft. Creates an atmosphere where the customer don't usually get best experience except for cheap fare. IE. Late nights no other drivers may be on road and we get an uberpool request 10 min. Not worth the drive leaving the passenger stranded., Allow tipping and pay drivers for distance traveled and wait time.
﻿Driver, #1 Pro: You can start driving when you want and stop driving when you want. #2 Pro: If you have the personality for this gig the wide variety of passengers can be make it very "interesting" at times., For cons... I would have to write a whole book to cover everything. And it is amazing to me how many drivers are themselves completely ignorant of the "cons" of this gig! I get many drivers as my passengers and I interact with drivers when I'm a passenger too most are newbies and just oblivious. Every single time I finish TEACHING other drivers what they don't know they are depressed and a few have told me they are..., Things that must stop: The "race to the bottom" in fare prices plus ever increasing fees that the driver does not share in; your refusal to add tipping in the app like Lyft; allowing drivers to drive without commercial insurance; etc... If a driver makes it past a few months in certain markets consider yourself lucky.
﻿The Walmart of Rideshare, Set your own schedule and can work whatever odd hours you want., Rideshare rates suck after having them continuously cut., Pay your workers a competitive rate.
﻿Worst.company.ever, The MacBook pro Free food Free black shirts Jokes at work, Discrimination Nepotism Sexism Low wages Angry people Bad culture Swarming with Sorority/fraternity people No one knows what's going on, :/
﻿Uber is a great company, , , 
﻿UberX - Good for what it is, Flexible to fit anyone's needs. Sometimes offer guarantees to reduce uncertainty of demand. Many improvements recently in clarity of information provided to drivers regarding user demand fare calculations and guarantee qualifications., Sometimes unpredictable. Earnings vary widely depending on peak vs off hours from as low as $10/hr to $25/hr after commission (but before expenses or taxes). Treated as a commodity not a human being at all. Difficult to communicate with operations to describe problems using platform., There must be some value in creating a welcoming and fruitful relationship with driver partners. Drivers are treated as a commodity and maybe they are at the end of the day. But this treatment is inconsistent with the image Uber portrays as helping people earn some extra money. For some this is a full time job
﻿Head of Recruitment, Great Company with lots of growth, All good lots of opportunities for growth, Keep moving !
﻿Exciting but challenging, - exciting growth and thus opportunities for direct impact, - rapid growth had led to bureaucratic roadblocks increasing, 
﻿False promising, The plus of working is that you receive the free schedule and a lot of people request as Uber is everywhere so you don't have to search a lot for the passengers. You also can rent a car as far as I know and work even if you don't own a car., The bonuses you receive are being calculated wrongly and also the cost of the rides are not worth the driving you do . The rides are really small pay and especially "pool" section gives you very little money., 
﻿After 6 year as a partner I realized is not a good job anymore., Reliable hours you work whenever you want, Not make money because of the whole competition in this market, Nothing
﻿Engineer, Very fast paced work environment. Lots of opportunity to learn and grow., Nothing much to say except that it is still a very new organization and the process are evolving and changing a lot., 
﻿Cool, Never know who youre driving lots if drunks traffic can suck sometimes No advancement, Maybe look to hire from within the company. This job is very temporary and people may want to move up., 
﻿Huge impact and a lot of learnings, - Constantly feeling stretched and involved in very impactful projects - Excellent culture of autonomy and execution, - Environment can be overwhelming for those coming from a more structured role/company -- a lot of flexibility is needed in order to successfully thrive in Uber, - Closely maintain the Uber start-up culture despite growing exponentially in number
﻿Uber FTE, Uber cares about their employees! I get the time off I need sick time and vacation leave. They also provide a comfortable environment and have a great open door policy., Not many cons in this company.,

﻿Great place to work, Really excited people fast paced environment. Uber is extremely good a leveraging resources and hasn't fallen into the pattern of creating comfortable/lazy engineers like many other companies do at this level of success., Falls for the same fallacies that everyone else in Silicon Valley falls for (most notably Confirmation Bias)., Place more emphasis on mastery of craft. You cannot abstract or engineer away the need for engineers to become masters in their domain.
﻿So Far So Good, , , 
﻿Promotes dangerous driving practices in order for drivers to make money., Flexible hours and a quick way to get cash in your pocket although when expenses are figured in at tax time drivers will find they net very little money., Out of touch with drivers and riders. The company (at least is Chicago) crams its Uber Pool option down the throat of riders and drivers. Rider app defaults to pool option with many not knowing what the option means or that they are actually requesting it. The option greatly increases the ride time for the customer if additional pool riders are picked up. Company claims that the Pool option increases driver earnings..., Bring your head above of the pile of money you are swimming in and learn how to treat your drivers better. Competing companies are aggressively trying to hire drivers away from Uber. Once real competition comes in the market you will quickly find yourself competing your profits down to zero. This will not matter to current Uber management as they will cash in on the eventual IPO once the cooling off period ends but...
﻿Driver, Meeting people and exercising professional and inviting customer service habits as well as defusing conflict agendas when they occur., Various routes on a daily basis to drive or navigate., Get more involved with the drivers daily tasks.
﻿Not worth the hype as driver, Easy extra money. That's all it is. Unfortunately your chances of making the advertised $460+ a week is slim unless you drive all week long., I average about $5 an hour in Oklahoma City on the weekends. Once a rider puts a negative rating on you there is no disputing it even if it's false., Allow drivers to protect there reputation by allowing a dispute method. I've got false marks on my profile and nothing I can do about it.
﻿Uber, working on your own schedule., No customer service agents to assist Uber drivers when needed, instead of emailing to Uber company we (drivers) when we have internet issues we need to be talking to a live person
﻿Driving for Uber or Lyft is not what you think, Make your own hours and drive and drive and drive until the wheels come off your asset. The best part is you will do it for FREE! That's the pros now check out he cons., I have been in business for myself for over 30 years and started driving for Uber at the behest of my wife and daughter who thought I would have fun driving for them. I told them that I thought it was ridiculous to treat your personal car as a cab hauling people around with all costs of operation including risk on your own back then UBER taking 25% plus riders fee as their take for virtually doing nothing except using..., No advice to management you don't need it. You have already developed a cash cow that uses people and their assets up until they are no use to you anymore with new ones replacing them daily. You treat them as employees under the guise of independent contractors getting your cake and eating it too. The scam will end some day but I'm sure you will be hiding in the Bahamas with your billions. Yes you know that already...
﻿easiest way to be an Entrepreneur, -work on your own schedule -so easy to use the app -good pay during surge -if you run it as a business- tax incentives -talking to so many people -it really can be fun -crazy stories both good and bad, -uber cares more about riders then drivers in the sense of pay.. It seems earnings per hour is going down -you might get a night when a drunk dude pukes in your car.. didn't happen to me but heard plenty of stories -if you're one to complain and want to be an employee.. go somewhere else, good job boys

Also advice on how to file taxes.

﻿UBER Driver, Flexible schedule. There is not really anything else I can say., Extremely low pay. The company support is handled by way of email and the response time is slow and the information is not helpful. I routinely have had issues with UBER not paying for tolls. It takes so much time to research the daily routes to see if a toll was charged and then go to the toll system and assess how much was charged and then get the information reported to UBER so they can properly reimburse. It shouldn't..., Pay UBER partners the full cost of running the business. Pay drivers for the tolls.
﻿Proactive VS Reactive, The people I worked with are some of the most talented and sociable individuals that I have ever known., Terrible pay (with terrible excuses for low pay) nonexistent work/life balance lack of HR poor communication between site locations zero opportunity for promotion or raises constant scheduled and cancelled meetings high turn-over rate in leadership... the list goes on and on., Learn to be proactive instead of reactive. This goes for the entire company not any manager at an individual level. So many major decisions were made by execs of the company without a single thought to the lower tiers such as customer support. However when those decisions yielded disastrous results the customer support teams were always blamed. Management and above please realize that CSRs and Uber partner-drivers...
﻿Plenty of opportunities if you can adapt to growth, - Strong engineering managers. From what I've seen on the money team managers here have a good business sense and also understand the value of giving engineers the freedom to create. I love how my boss is watching over my progress as an engineer and helping get blockers out of my way - Plenty of challenging problems. Uber is growing fast and the business inherently is technically challenging from an engineering perspective..., - dealing with systems that have not adapted to Uber's growth. Uber has grown so fast that many of the systems are starting to look hacked together. As an engineer that values simple architecture it could be painful at times., I would advise to pay attention to 2 things that may feel the pain of growth the most: - hiring practices. Ensure we're introspective in our approach and take hiring seriously so as to not lower the quality of hires. - architecture. Uber's growth has caused a lot of technical pain we should be seriously considering the tradeoffs of future-proof systems or even writing the infrastructure that would facilitate quick...
﻿Not a very welcoming environment, I was working as Partner Support Representative for a few months I decided not to extend my contract however I loved working with the drivers and supporting them with on-boarding. Their stories and what the job means to them was very inspiring and gave meaning to what I was doing., As a white girl I never thought about diversity before UBER however at this job it was impossible to ignore the lack of it. - Majority of drivers were from a diverse range of minority groups that you can find in NYC that's expected anyone that understand the driver landscape in NYC will know this. However the entire office in Manhattan is white. This created a very strange dynamic in a already tense environment...., - Hire staff with diverse backgrounds don't just hire from the same Universities - Ex. UBER eats hire people that have backgrounds in the restaurants industry that can leverage their network. There are a lot of positions where a tech background isn't necessary especially in Sales. - Be open to people in the entire city New York is a very diverse city with amazing talent there is no reason the office is so homogeneous....
﻿Waste of an investment, No real pros because your not your own boss you can be fired or cut off from being uber partner everyone and anyone can say anything criticized from passengers. No real ownership or control of your Own so called uber business. Stars get too low your fired no round trip method for customers. Double booked even though you still have passengers fired for cancel to many trips. Why invest if you being told how to operate...., Drivers can be fired for any reason without law enforcement involved or any real serious issue arising. While drivers take on all the risk of picking up random people of the public community., Uber lease cars are company cars. No way walk in to a dealership with 600 dollars get brand new car on our own. But through uber program being a partner a contract worker or employee they have no title for drivers. It was made possible.. But don't get fired or you will still be left with payments and a brand new expensive car that no longer has ties to uber so suddenly.
﻿Uber makes life easy., The advantages of UBER is basically it saves time and it ain't time consuming it makes life easier for every individual and it's very safe especially for the ladies to travel around the city. The best part is you don't have to walk about 1 or 2km to find a taxi it just arrives wherever you are. And the rates are quite worth it for a peaceful ride to your destination., There are no such disadvantaged well there are very quite few. It's just not that everyone is aware of UBER so there is a lot of advertising should be done so that you people create an awareness to our customers., 
﻿Operation Coordinator, It is a start-up. More early you got in more opportunities you will get. Your opinions matter when the company was still small. You can directly be in a meeting with the GM and offer your opinion from your side. It is pretty amazing., Too much workload comparing to salary. You need high efficiency to balance work and life. It's a start-up. There are too many things unexpected and unperfect. You will be under high workload especially when crisis happens., When the company become bigger and bigger administration needs to be taken into considerations. Career path for employee needs to be established somehow in someway.
﻿Fake surges that offer no riders., Driving 15 mins to pick up and 5 mins to drop off equals very low rate of pay. Future tax implications full responsibility of driver. It is unfair to expect the driver to have mints and bottled water to assure a five star rating from the rider and expect no tip from the rider because of the company policy of not having the ability to tip in the application. Racist passengers who glare at you because they do not have..., Stop with the fake coloring of the map to make out like business is available only to have the driver waste valuable time and money waiting for what may eventually happen during non surge hours. Pay drivers more of the sixty BILLION you are worth and share the wealth; after all the wheels on the car go round and round if they stop UBER is screwed., 
﻿Driving Partner, Choose own days and hours of work no dress code., Limited feedback from drivers on passengers feed back from passengers on drivers too subjective poor pay hard on your vehicle, Passenger feedback should be pointed questions related to the trip Like "Did your driver greet and thank you?"
﻿Uber driver biggest waste of time and money, The ONLY pro is working when you want to and not having constant supervision aka micro management., Uber keeps drivers worried about ratings so they don't realize what they are doing to their own cars - beating them up putting thousands of miles on plus wear and tear. Spending more than you make on gasoline. And once you're a veteran you barely get ride requests anymore. The other funny thing I've seen on this webpage is that Uber responds to people in all positions EXCEPT drivers. Answer that one alevy at Uber..., Care about your drivers and their input. You only care about your internal employees who seem to have quite a different experience than drivers do.
﻿It doesn't worth it, If you have enough money and just want to uber for fan - go ahead!, It takes a lot of time to earn reasonable money. It waste of time overall.,

﻿UberX Driver, The app is better designed for drivers than the Lyft app (Lyft has one app both for customers and drivers whereas Uber has separate apps for customers and drivers). Business for Uber is fairly steady., Uber takes a 25% cut from driver's earnings (whereas Lyft only takes 20%). Uber does not allow customers to tip drivers (whereas Lyft does)., To remain competitive with Lyft Uber should match the same benefits that Lyft gives to its drivers (i.e. 20% cut not 25% cut of driver earnings allow customers to tip drivers if they want to).

Please keep employees valuation a priority. The higher the valuation the better customer service will be. It will come back to you ten-fold from employees clients (riders) and communities. Thanks for such an innovative idea!
﻿Uber, Growth oriented environment and culture to work in. The interview process is really good as it is unbiased and it is based on real life business situations., Nothing as such.

Plus not putting mileage on my personal vehicle., Nonethey already know how to prey on people
﻿Driver, Work anytime u want to., Sometime meet some rude rider., GPS take u to wrong entrance or location then rider refuse to have the trip record and deal with uber support then they try to argue for the couple dollar fare that uber support will adjust soon. Cheap rider who have no patience.
﻿why no tips?, Uber offers very flexible schedules. Which is perfect for me while i earn a decent money. Depending on what platform you drive on., Customers dont have the option to leave a tip in the app for the uber drivers. Also to make great oney on the uber x platform long hours are required. Star-rating system is unfair and non-transparent, Keep your drivers happy by allowing customers to leave tips and increased the fare rates. Riders are already saving a ton of money raising the fare price wont hurt them.
﻿Driver, Flexible Schedule Good pay Time with family., Slow business Average pay bad time, Good company to use.
﻿Great and Flexible Job It is what it is, Flexible Scheduling Ability to make money is uncapped Making connections daily, Putting miles on your vehicle Depending on when you work losing nights to go out, Create a tipp option to reflect the level of customer service each driver provides.
﻿Concierge/Chauffer, Great tool to network for clientele, Working long hours and underpaid, Think about your partners/employees
﻿Cool, Rate increase choose own hours choose where u want to work and when ur done, Don't get paid distance to pick up customers. Only once they are in your car. And u dont know how clise or far they want to go until u get them, Pay us mileage even route to get passengers

﻿UberX partner, Freedom to work when you want., Over saturation of the market with drivers vs riders., Adjust drivers to riders in a single market.
﻿Software Engineer I, The company is dynamic and growing really fast. There are business travels occurring often. People are very energetic and smart., It is slowly turning in a large enterprise it has more than 6000 employees now so if you're looking for a startup environment it's not the place to go., Try to still give a lot of freedom of choice to the employees it can be more bottom-up.
﻿Marketing Intern, Amazing culture through growth & development - I loved every second of it., Hard to move up - not as much career development specifically for interns compared to other in-house employees.,

﻿Uber?, Easy job. Fair pay. Fun. Nice management, Hard to get people to sign up. A lot of people already have it, 
﻿sourcer, , , 
﻿Extra cash as part time income., Simplicity. It's real simply to start and you can set your own hours. Great way to get to know the city., Uber pool sucks. You'd find your self driving non-stop 40 mins for $20 whereas driving uber X can earn you 30+., Upgrade navigation and take good care of the drivers.
﻿Remote CSR (no more), It was fun working remotely for Uber while they were setting up their rider and driver email contact system. Things changed a lot but our manager did his best to keep us updated., You did a lot better working with their system if you have a Mac than if you had any other type of operating system., 
﻿Great in theory; potential there., Set own hours. Meet interesting people. Reliable payment method., Over saturated with drivers. No tips. Hot zones don't work out., Limit drivers so Uber can be a great way to earn money for a driver instead of a mediocre way. Hot zones never provided me with a fare.
﻿College Job, Ok. Decent money. Make your own hours., drunks. Bad rates. A lot of wear on car, 
﻿Fast paced great product but be warned..., Uber's environment is like no other - both good and bad. There is no other company out there like it now in the valley and as they say things are moving like a roller coaster. The platform is phenomenal and it will be exciting to see what directions the company takes. Great perks and awesome work spaces. Uber truly has the potential to be that dream job (but unfortunately they cannot fufill on critical aspect of..., The talent Uber is trying to bring on (and keep) requires the same in management and in some instances this isn't the case. The really bad: Expect long work hours an engineer-focused culture and total lack of HR boundaries (read: don't be surprised by management verbally abusing/insulting employees). Employees are not valued management experience is questionable at best and pay is below industry standard., Please keep the fun and exciting work environment that Uber is known for but also keep in mind that the company is growing up and needs to be taken seriously. Treat employees with respect - employees are just as critical to the success of the business as customers.
﻿Tough but impactful, You get to do amazing things at Uber right off the bat. You have immediate credibility and are expected to produce results immediately. The CEO is a genius beyond compare., The leadership directly under the CEO is a mess. They are with a few exceptions like a pack of snarling dogs trying to throw each other under the bus so they can look good to the CEO. They are not good managers and in some cases not good people., Demand more out of the CEO's direct reports.
﻿Good place to plant the seed., If you're looking for post-grad experience or something to hold you over financially this might be a good fit for you. For the most part the people that share the same status as you are enjoyable to be around and can be there for help whenever you need it. In regards to perks you can expect to dress casual everyday have access to a limited snack selection and eat a catered lunch/dinner daily (which I personally..., Unfortunately the room to develop outside of working at the support center is somewhat bleak. Being the front lines of handling Uber's messy situations is complimented with a standard customer service wage (see Google for average salary) and monotonous daily tasks. Additionally the work life balance is something talked about throughout the entire company. You'll notice that it applies to this position as well. Your..., To be blunt (in the most polite way possible) the leadership team needs to step it up. While your professional titles may include "Manager" at surface level please take the word "leader" in leadership to heart as much as you can. You're in a great position to learn more about yourself by genuinely taking the time to help your team connect and develop to be better people. We know that a lot of pressure is thrown upon...
﻿Quality is job zero, Decent pay. Ability to learn new technologies on company time. Quantity more important than quality. Lots of super-smart and industrious coworkers., Quantity more important than quality - friends make jokes about the number of Uber app updates for bug fixes. Work environment. Travel arrangements-roommates? Nasty review system. Poor treatment of contract employees. Huge turnover., Quit worry about becoming billionaires like the founder. Treat contractors like employees. Get the lawsuits settled so we can get back to work.
﻿UberGOOD, Work Atmosphere. You are inspired to do your best and to move forward. The hierarchy is always available and everyone is working towards one common goal to be able to provide the best service. The team is its biggest strength, The work is such that you have to be good at managing your time or you would not be able to take time out for yourself., 
﻿Working with Uber had been an interesting experience ., Meeting people from all over the world and having great conversations with them. They are very greatful for Uber drivers and are very respectful. Driving increases your chances to see different parts of Texas while making money. Ever ride is a different story!, Traffic can be a little hectic and the roads are always under construction which can make your driving destination confusing. Maps for Uber are not always easy to follow especially if the customer is in a building in a large parking lot making its hard to find the rider?, They do a great job informing drivers of upcoming events.
﻿This is UBER Rabbit Hole to make billions but not for the drivers., Flexible Job Schedule. Work when you want., No life cause you have to drive all the time to pay your bills. I just did my first run with uber to have an idea about how much I can make driving. Here is the break down below for one hour of driving In one hour I made $13.50 doing 2 trips with $0 in tips. After my gas cost $3.50 I will get $10 for the hour If I count my car maintenance and tax. This will come down to minimum wage If I consider depreciation..., Make more payout to the driver who are making money for you. Instead of shoving in your fat pockets and making billions.
﻿Uber Driver, As an Uber driver you create your own hours and work whenever you want. As long as you are comfortable driving and talking to people it is a very fun job., In some areas the demand is not very high. Also the rating system is very subjective and can cause you to lose your job., Accept more driver input on important issues. The fares are also too low to make a decent income in many cities.
﻿Part Time Uber Driver, Flexible hours and days can work in areas you want too., Pay has gone down already since I joined 6 months ago. Long trips between pickups., 
﻿MBA Internship, Pretty good ownership of work fun people and office fast pace free swag $400 in ride credits per month, Compensation is middle of the road no pre-planned path for interns to return post-graduation a lot of jargon etc to catch up on when you get there, Make this a sort of job interview like at other tech companies so you can come back after you graduate!
﻿Not bad, You get to make your own schedule Pay is good depending on your city., The car inspections that are mandatory, Unk
﻿Operation Intern, Creative and energetic team. Best team mate around the world., Because its the start up and the management is disorganized., 
﻿Marketing Intern, Fast paced dynamic enthusiastic creative cultural, less time for social life long hours, 
﻿Be careful, Lots of growth plenty of work to be done if you can handle the culture., Working 60+ hour weeks is normal here engineers also work weekends frequently. It's hard to get leave for more than a week (even though it's supposed to be unlimited). There's a culture of sexism and sexist jokes which seems to be tolerated by senior engineers and management. Lots of engineering problems - system failures downtime lots of on-call work and stress cost cutting is pretty rampant too it's hard to..., Stop cost cutting it's impacting your employee's ability to do their jobs. Improve compensation so that we can hire better engineers.
﻿it's ok, work when you want work as much as you want, software could use some work to many bad pins, 
﻿Hardly worth it, Flexibility - the biggest pro as a driver by far. Meeting new and interesting people even a little networking can be worked into it, Wear and tear on your vehicle Considerably lower income than they will lead you to believe Harassing emails - example. I receive at least one email per week threatening to have my account deactivated unless I take my first trip. I have taken hundreds it's not that I think it will actually happen it just shows a lack of organization or bad programming., 
﻿Uber driver, Great Company to work with., In CA they need to raise rates. Also when doing LAX need a return ride back to OC. CA gas prices make it very hard to make money., Bring the rates back!
﻿Worst Co. On the planet, Zero. They rip off everyone and are dishonest., It's all downside. Shadiest company I've ever seen., Get a life.
﻿Used to be good not anymore, Unlimited flexibility certain days and times the pay is incredible., Not consistent pay. Contract employee no benefit high taxes., Pay more
﻿Smoke and mirrors, Great coworkers in an overall low pressure laid back atmosphere. Being a part of a company that has become such a big part of current pop culture was an interesting and exciting experience -- high "glitz and glam" factor in comparison to most jobs. It's not retail., Communication was minimal from the top and continued to weaken as messages passed down from upper levels to lower levels of employee clearance. As a young organization whose goal has been to redefine a longstanding industry (which it has successfully done!) the company still has a lot to learn in terms of positive vs. negative "corporate attitude" and general organizational human resource management -- many policies and..., Spend some time and attention in developing the possibilities for growth within the company for your external contractors or at least decide for sure if that is something that the company would like to have as a focus rather than send mixed messages to your PT staff. As someone who was ready and willing to fully dedicate myself to the job and the company I felt like much of what I was told were just empty promises and...
﻿Blood Suckers, There are no positives at Uber. Travis Kalanick exploits his drivers to the maximum., Drive for Uber and take all the equity out of your car and transfer it to Travis Kalanick . You might as well not drive for Uber just stay home and send Travis Kalanick a check., Stop exploiting your drivers with your nasty bag of tricks. The turnover at Uber is their way of getting more suckers who are bad at math. Who can't figure out that in reality they are making less than mimum wage.
﻿Marketing Department, I can manage about clients & any kind of challenging work. that 's why I am interested about this job, Marketing give so much opportunity & problem both helpful problems give experience to me & this experience is opportunity in future, Target & hit the way it must be goal
﻿I had a good experience but there is no future to me was very stressful job and benefits at all., work when you can and the best when you have no boss perfect for a part time job, sometimes is very hard to make people happy and you want to earn more but limited ans very stressful job after while., 
﻿Uber driver, Set your own schedule make a little money in your spare time., Unpredictable pay vehicle costs lots of personal risk low pay for amount of effort put it, Stop dropping rates to unworkable levels. Uber only needs to provide a service that is better than the local taxis and people WILL pay for it.
﻿the worst business i ever see driving for uber, shame of them how they trate the driver claiming are independent contractors but give them order as enployer if drivers are not obey they close the acount, i sugest to every body for not buy car before driving for this company with short rental car i left with 50k demage after i been misleading by them,

﻿Awesome culture, , , 
﻿No communication, Awesome company with a forward thinking idea. Flexible work hours attract a lot of part time drivers. Easy to maneuver the app. Great job!, Ok...here in Houston...the lack of communication with anyone at Uber is an epic fail. If you get any communication at all it is canned responses that do NOT address the initial question. Or you get a person in Bangladesh that uses canned responses. There is no contact number or live person to help you. This has to change!, You must have management in the area that drivers can call for issues.
﻿Driver, Flexibility meet and interact with interesting people and unlimited earning potential., Fixed fee structure and Uber decides when to lower the fares., Don't continue to lower the fares. Costs keep going up while fares continue to decrease.
﻿Driver, I'm able to work at any time of the day/evening. I enjoy interacting with costumers. I create my own hours., When working on weekends after hours I'll get costumers under the influence of alcohol and they have a tendency of either getting sick n my vehicle or talking to much rubbish., None at this time because I'm still learning the industry of being a public driver. Maybe with a bit more driving I may come up with suggestions.
﻿Fast paced environment plenty of opportunity, I work amazing people who work hard to solve really difficult problems I learn loads every day the pace is very fast! I'm empowered to take ownership of problems and solve them day to day as well as with longer projects. No problem at Uber is ever too big to be solved, The hours are definitely long and expectations are high but this culture allows the small teams to achieve big things, Keep the high performance culture up but make sure employees don't get burnt out
﻿Disregard driver's problems, work when you like. Flexible. no pressure from boss or coworker., Uber management should address driver's problem and cut down on the percentage the company charge almost 28% fee on the total income(which is a mafia rate)., Cut down the uber fee for drivers and adress thei problem. CSR sounds like uneducated.
﻿if you like to work for charity its perfect place, nothing good to say I am sure everyone who put out there vehicle takes the risk to be on the road with all the accident wear and tear and not to forget the risk of rock breaking your windshield is constant deserve to be paid We not here to provide Red cross service, Putting a lot of mileage on your car and get paid less than a 1/3 of a normal Cab rate if you like to provide free volunteer services and get no respect from obnoxious customer its a perfect opportunityI worked for one day and what a mistake has it been. Good luck, how do you justify paying a 30 mile trip at rush hour that takes1hour 17 minutes to complete due to traffic and pay a driver $23. Maybe it makes sense to you guys it doesn't make any to me
﻿Drivers, It wasn't not nice sonetime, I wish they did better by communicating with people, I wish there was someone live to talk to when I worked with Uber
﻿X driver, Hours are good but you don't get paid a lot, Pay is terrible. Have to rent ur car. Cost outweighs what u make., Get it together and be more fair to your drivers
﻿Uber, They have over a million drivers they take over 40% of the fares. Pay there driver less the 40cent a mile .. The avg driver is making about 2.00 an hour  drive do the math  they're crooks..Who is exploiting the taxi business to make billions poor peoples back, Who is exploiting the taxi business to make billions poor peoples back there is no pros cons to Crooks, there is no pros cons to CrooksWord to the wise don't work for them Crooks ..you will spend more money than you make
﻿Very hard work big rewards, The ability to really make an impact. No matter your role you can always make a difference. Hard work is recognized and rewarded. If you want to grow professionally and add a great experience to your resume and don't mind losing sleep over it this is a great employer, Long long hours and lots of travel. Combining a job at Uber with a family can be challenging and balancing the two will ask a lot of you and your family., 
﻿Driver, Be your own boss and work your own hours.Meet Great people and act as ambassador to visitors in our great city., No tips included in application which makes it hard for the customer to show their appreciation. Would like to talk to management when a problem arises instead of emai., None at this time unless they can give us a larger slice of the pie.Maybe 86% to is and 15% to them.
﻿No money with Uber, Can work when you want., You don't make hardly any money use a lot of gas and miles on your car isn't worth it., 
﻿driver, its good that as a driver i am able to make my own schedule, no money and customers service are inexperienced, none
﻿Driver, Cheaper then a Taxi and more reliable., Intoxicated customers can be an issue., Self-Employed
﻿I've learned a lot but the leadership is immature and lacking and the environment is relentless, Work life balance in not valued; uber does not acknowledge or value an employee's life outside of work and churns through employees, Start to think longer term and invest in your talent for the long run rather than forcing them to "hit their redline"., 
﻿Uber, Set you own schedule. The pay can be good. It nice to be able to truly work for yourself. I would recommend it to anyone that has extra vehicles. They are looking to get into the delivery business as well which can be even better., Its wear and tear on your vehicle and a lot of miles running your car in the ground and spend lots of money gassing up your car., Maybe think of ways to help drivers with some sort of assistance to help with the wear and tear on your vehicle.
﻿Truly Unlike Any Other Company You Could Work For, Amazing and unprecedented growth as a company which requires you to be able to scale in your own role but also challenges you to continue innovating to solve for our biggest business challenges and continue moving Uber forward in how we are thinking about disrupting and reimagining the world's transportation., If you are uncomfortable with working hard moving at a fast pace scaling in your own role and with being a builder then it would not be the right place for you. However if you enjoy building and contributing to the business in a very impactful and thoughtful way then there are interesting problems to solve and work to be done with an amazingly smart and motivated group of people., 
﻿NOT TOO SHABBY, The pay is actually not bad but you also have to take in account of the car deterioration from driving full or part-time. So overall it is best to work mainly on busy days and nights like weekends and holidays. Those nights you can easily rack up up about $100-300 a night. About 4-6 hours of driving. That is my rough estimate. In the Raleigh/ Wilmington NC area., I didn't really see many cons other than they probably need to increase fare prices a little bit especially for full-time drivers that solely survive off of Uber., I didn't really need to talk to management. They seemed pretty good. One time a customer accidentally dented the hood of my car so i filed a report and management said to take pictures and take it to a dealership for a price quota. So not too shabby.
﻿Driver Little Rock Ar, Flexible Schedule interesting conversations with passengers I have time for other ways to make money since Uber has cut pay and it's impossible to make a living just driving., Pay. $5-$8 hr. --Uber cut rates and our pay 40% in January and many drivers stopped driving because many times you make minimum wage or less., Cutting rates DOESN'T attract new riders. WHAT it does is causes surges that ANGERS riders because drivers aren't available. Many drivers here have quit working and riders ask where the drivers have gone... Try advertising instead. Local Arkansans don't have a clue what an Uber IS!!
﻿When you want, Literally can get up and work when you want. Weekly pay. A way to meet different people. Forces you to learn your city. Rewards program., Tolls and things of that nature, 
﻿Driver Expirence, You can work when you want to work. Most people work during the surge periods which are the weekends., Uber keeps dropping the rates drives make but they keep the percentage they make the same. Uber should reduce their percentage so the driver is not affected by competitive rate changes., Reduce your percentage so driver can make a living. Right now you lower the drivers rates but keep your commissions the same which is hurting the drivers.
﻿Not as shiny as it looks from the outside, - Lots of perks - Good benefits - Amazing people - Company events, - Very limited growth opportunities - Culture - Underpaid employees, Stop hiring people to fire them less than a year later

﻿Not treat Engineer well, Free unhealthy lunch and snacks., Don't care about Engineers and their health.,

﻿Driver, Covenient for someone who wants to make extra money. You can start and end the day whenever you want. You are your own boss., Your pay fluctuates. Driving is not for everyone. You lose money driving to pick up passengers. Tip needs to be added how lyft has it for their drivers., Change pay structure so that drivers get paid a little bit more than minimum wage. The partner app tends to crash and reverts back to its old self.
﻿Uber, it super duper good high key recommend. the money is great plus the tips is better, this one time I had to drive a drunk home and he threw up in my car and then he ditched w/o tipping,

﻿Only a Temp Job, You meet different drunks or jerks each day you work., You are only making money for your own car's wear and tear insurance and gas. Ratings from passengers even though you go beyond your duties you'll get a poor score. The scoring will drop you so fast until you are terminated. I've only made less than 20 rides., Please make the scoring systems more fair. I know you guys charge to restore a driver's ratings.

You end up averaging about $5 per ride two rides an hour. After gas and upkeep it's less than minimum. If you are OK with drunk riders you can make more. But they will be a bit scary occasionally pass out and might vomit in your car., Pay more people. Take less of a percentage so folks can be proud to drive for you. At this point it feels like you're letting greed take advantage of people in need of a job.

I've been working for two months and they've already increase their..., Start caring about the people that are out on the streets making you money and keeping you employed!
﻿It's been a learning experience., Like the flexibility of deciding when I will work. Meet lots of interesting people., Put allot of miles on car Have to drive miles to pick up some rides No tipping policy, Give the customer an option to include a tip in fare.
﻿Met interesting people, did not like some of the areas traveled into, Keep expanding, 
﻿Office Manager, Tons of agency and independence huge learning opportunities part of something really impactful, The role extends well beyond what is outlined long hours lean teams mean you end of getting stretched super thin and feeling overworked, 
﻿Pays Less then Minimum wage, Can make own hours flexible hours. Meet new people, Pay is terrible rarely if ever do you get a tip. The Mileage will destroy your car in no time even driving part time. Average UBER driver lasts 4 months. UBER always has money to throw at new referrals though. Business model is predicated on of constantly recruiting new drivers cannot go of forever however as word has gotten out driving for UBER is a scam., Cap the number of drivers (City Council would need to do this as UBER would never agree to it) and set a decent rate. Current rate is a 1/3 the cost of a Taxi Cab. Its ridiculous.

People who did well got the praises on their own without politics playing any role in it. Free food and drinks all throughout the day., All the pros mentioned above are old story. The food quality has gone from bad to worse and it's not even edible anymore. Uber has hired people left right and center. Managers hire people from their previous companies either peers or reports so that they have people to support them. Almost all the managers and higher management guys are super selfish and arrogant. NOBODY thinks about advancing their reports and taking..., Start thinking about your reports instead of concentrating on hiring more people to report to you and fighting to climb the management ladder yourself. Care about your employees who have loads of great opportunities to work outside of Uber with a great manager who helps them advance their career or forget about it it's just gonna get worse so have fun losing the talent.

﻿Uber not really worth it as a driver, Freedom to work your own hours and meet new people., Flawed rating system.

﻿On-Boarding Support Specialist, Meet lof people if you do like helping people that the great job for you., There's not actually beside it's very difficult to know what's going on in a big company like Uber., Would have been great if they do have meeting with the On-Boarding Support Specialist for any updates.
﻿Good place growing up your career sense, 1. Free to talk free to pickup challenges free to work on what you liked. 2. Fully trusted by other guys and the manager have a word to say about products that's been worked on. 3. I always come to the office at 11:00 ;) 4. Cooperative colleges. Everyone is eager to help others out passionate on all-win., Well food might not be that good as those provided in some specific companies LOL, 
﻿Good and the Bad, Boring for long periods of time Uber keeps lowering the price The company does not take drivers into enough consideration, respect your drivers put more money in their hands, 
﻿low pay many hours, , , 
﻿Working For Youself is Great! A couple Disconnections with it though., Driver support is through email and most "support" representatives do not actually read emails sent to them they just respond like a robot. It can be a nightmare if you're having a log in issue like I did. it took many emails and weeks to fix., Have customer support available by phone for drivers. For the app I'd recommend prompting riders to leave an explanation for anything lower than a five star rating. Most riders have no idea our employment depends on it. Also a 30 second video explaining to new riders the rating process and being a rider when they get the app would also help., 
﻿Fun Job, Could be a dangerous when drunk passengers, improve safety, 
﻿Learning Experience, Great experience employees are very smart, Salary and no guarantee of a full-time role., 
﻿Not all it's cracked up to be, Flex working hours interesting passengers, Wear and tear on car irate passengers low rates which continue to be decreased by the company. Rides are accepted "blind" meaning you don't know if someone is going 2 hours away (and 2 hours back) until they are in the car which causes issues if you need to pick up your kids in an hour. Drive 10 minutes to pick someone up sit at their guard gate for 5 minutes then drive them for 2 miles for $2.37. Uber encourages..., Give the driver a minimum take-home fare of $5 per ride. Develop these filters: destination time allocation "female safe" ride guarantee. Encourage passengers to tip if they are taking a cheap ride. Find the balance between being cheap to your drivers vs. beating your competition's rates. Set fares which allow drivers to make a living wage without being forced to drive inebriated passengers around at 3 a.m. surge times.
﻿Uber, , , 
﻿just to get the millions of messages from glassdoor, Flexible schedule I am a man trying to get ahead in this world and trying to get a real job is difficult, Horrible support and lowering rates while raising commissions FROM drivers I am a man trying to get ahead in this world, Treat your employees with respect that other things are happening in your lives and that uber is not the only reason to live
﻿Marketing, Strong tech company recognized name catered lunch, Compensation End of year scoring system Unclear KPIs Weak Sr. management, 
﻿Rates Kept Dropping, I loved the flexible working hours being able to go online whenever I want to work and then stopping whenever I want. The pay was okay in the beginning and I learned cool random information from some of my riders., The rates kept dropping until it wasn't really worth it to drive for them anymore. Plus there was a change in the insurance requirements and the ridesharing insurance was more expensive. Not really worth it as a part-time driver., Raise the rates so drivers can afford to keep driving.
﻿Doesn't pay very well., Flexible hours Fun conversations with riders, If you really consider your overall costs (including mileage at Federal rates additional cell phone regular car cleaning) you may not be making any money. Whenever I talk with an Uber employee I mostly get non-answers. e.g. what to do about rider ratings etc. Although I see Surge pricing on screen I don't seem to ever get those rides. Got one once., To make this worthwhile pay your contractors so that they clear at least $10 per hour after expenses. Otherwise this isn't worth the time required.
﻿Driver, Able to manage my own schedule according to aligibility of hours in daily routines, Not able to see a location until the driver is already in car and trip is accepted not knowing how far the passenger will take the driver at high rates hours., 
﻿Partner support Rep, Good hours fun people changing enviornmet, No benefits not a full time gig, Market rep positions as segways for full time employment
﻿Great People & Great Environment, - Great co-workers - Obtainable goals and initiatives - seemingly open-ended company growth - modern facility - monthly allotment of credits to be used for any Uber service - Lunch snacks and drinks provided - Benefits - Sense of pride in being involved with the daily operation of meaningful and cutting edge tech - Biweekly 1:1 status meetings with manager. - 'Open-door' policy is in full effect and treated..., - Pay does leave much to be desired although perks do help with cost of living - Facilities just a touch difficult to get to by public transit especially on weekends - Although plenty of growth potential exact processes are not clear cut., Company directives that are coming from the top-down especially when they require immediate change could be better prepped and communicated. However I feel that management is doing an outstanding job of keeping the team informed on short and midterm goals and providing beneficial information when it is made available to them.
﻿Contracted Driver, , , 
﻿Flexible, make money everyday freedom to do other things you need to do, instability in earnings. constant maintenance., increase the the fairs. the price drop only benefits the corporate and the riders while the driver's are getting shafted
﻿Driver, Flexible hours the ability to drive around and ponder why you made the decision to work for these con artists., They rob you. Take a higher percentage than advertised. Cut rates. It's a total scam. Do not drive for them ever. Run away., Stop stealing. You're thieves. There is a special place in hell for companies like this. Don't drive for them you'll regret it.
﻿Driver, Love this company great opportunity to be your own boss, Pay is a little low if you own your own car without a car payment the earning potential is great. You just have to be willing and committed, Better screening for drivers higher pay
﻿Good culture, Great pay nice people easy to work into schedule, Poor communication Do not like the new pay system, 
﻿Driving, Meet amazing people on a daily basis. The money is fantastic for how basic the job really is. I had a great time driving people and it fits well as any side job., A lot of people think they own your vehicle. People as a whole can just be entitled and rude so driving every day is frustrating at times., 
﻿Driving my goals, Set own hours comfortable environment fun incentives get to explore new parts of the city., Really hard to stop driving and stick to an end of day schedule very easy to neglect social obligations in the weekend, Don't cut rates without giving balancing incentives. Keep providing more incentives times like the gas card program and carwash. Somega kind of meal discount program would be awesome too so I'd eat less dollar menu on the weekends ( But hey I'm stingy and focusing on my ROI!)
﻿Inconsistency in various markets, Flexibility. Good side gig for those without a girlfriend or family., After uber takes away 20% you still have to pay income tax at the end of the year. Rack up lots of unnecessary miles on your car with lots of wear and tear. Riders don't care since it's not their car feet on the seats eating trash ect. Better keep your mouth shut as everything you say could be used against you in a rider review. Benefits what benefits?, What is applied in another market should be same throughout. Drivers from other markets shouldn't be allowed to have the clear advantage over local ones. I have clearly seen this but your staff repeatedly denied it.
﻿Marketing Manager, Back in the day ISO's were offered in lieu of higher salary. The hope is that these will be valuable once the company goes public., Very little work-life balance & untrained/unqualified senior management. All of my "seniors" were 3-4 years out of undergrad and had maybe worked one other job yet because of seniority they were promoted. This led to a lot of issues., Train your managers!
﻿Good Company, Changing the world. Very exciting to be part of such Uber at this time., We could see higher pay based on the economical state of the SIlicon Valley., 
﻿DRIVER, My own schedule Good work/personal balance, Pay People Traffic Constant sitting in a car, 
﻿Operations Coordinator, 1. Big advancement in terms of personal abilities 2. Great autonomy 3. Flat management, 1. Zero work-life balance 2. Pay is not as good, 1. Increase pay
﻿Ride share Taxi Driver, Set my own schedule meet new people help others work part time which is what I need. I guess it's good I never earned very much I won't be paying hardly any taxes if any once I subtract deductibles. I learned a great deal about myself and the city I live in. I am happy if this opens the door for people to get a car even if it is a leased car- that is still 4 wheels. One great thing that does come from my giving Uber..., Rarely daytime surges compared to evening. I am unable to drive evening hours-therefore unable to make the same money as drivers who work evening hours. Advertised pay never is what is earned Especially once gas and wear and tear on the car is subtracted. I went into this with my eyes open only wanting to make enough to make my car payment and insurance payment but I have not even been able to maintain that due to..., 1) Specifically advertise most likely NOT suitable to physically handicapped. 2)Require local meetings be attended BEFORE the person is a accepted as a partner. There needed to be cohesiveness with the drivers - it needs to start before they are hired. MORE Driver events need to occur/Driver coffees. 3) The company needs to stress that a living wage cannot/CANNOT be earned by driving in the daytime only. 4) MORE training...
﻿Great place to work!, Benefits management and Co wielders are great, I'm planning compensation should be more, 
﻿$ per miles, low paying per miles, Good for short distant drivers...., I drove someone for 27 miles take me 33 minutes to get her there that not include the time to go pick her up and come back.... I earns 18 dollars for that trip.... I'm happy for for entire day for what i makes but come one uber 0.85 per miles?
﻿Marketing Manager, They understand their employees and they want to do whats best for them and the company., With the company growing so quickly their can be hires that aren't the perfect fit for what the company wants to portray., 
﻿Driver/partner, I get to be my own boss choose my own hours and everything is a tax write off. The freedom is great really., Their management is absolutely atrocious...that's sadly putting it mildly. It was brilliant idea for a business that should be treated as such. Bad for the workers but at least it's great for the customers., Talk to each other! Unfortunately they desperately need to learn to communicate. They should also find a way to work with an insurance company. They don't want to insure Uber drivers because they spend way more time behind the wheel making them in their eyes a potentially very expensive liability.
﻿A company that is changing the world - and valuing employees!, Health benefits gym reimbursement free ride credit fantastic coworkers a "no toe stepping" policy supportive management and clear upward mobility., You better enjoy being logged in and connected - because you'll be working a lot (but it's fun so it doesn't really FEEL like work)., 
﻿Learn and grow at lightning speed, Very collaborative environment unlike what is perceived outside Lots of impact to make - opportunity at every step Management appreciative of people who deliver, As the company grew too quickly sanely re-organizing it takes time, Keep building the trust with the employees everyone appreciates it
﻿Recruitment Coordinator, Through the rough job of being an RC I instantly bonded with colleagues in the same position. These people are warm kind and engaging., To anyone looking into a contract recruitment position at Uber should have a strong head on their shoulders to handle the "wild ride" ahead of them. In my six months at Uber I had three managers 2 teams and 4 different seat changes. I had zero career development mentorship or any long term conversations at my future at Uber. This is directly correlated to the technical recruitment leadership and management at Uber..., 
﻿Uber Driver, This job provides flexibility and allows you to set your own schedule and thus control your overall income dependent on the amount of time and energy that you put in, Uber continues to mistreat drivers by cutting rates employing deceptive and manipulative tactics and towing the line between independent contractor and FTE, Stop cutting rates at the expense of your drivers. Not only does this necessarily reduce the quality of your contract employees but it hurts your customer experience as well. At some point with the size that you've obtained you'll have to stabilize earnings to ensure consistent employees.
﻿Uber Driver in Denver, You can start working at any time you want and you meet all types of people. and I like surge price., Pay is very low for a basic ride I get around $2.20 per short ride. I hope they would raise it in the future. Beginning in 2016 they take 25% of what you earn., Return more for the driver especially for the short distance ride.
﻿Uber Atlanta, Make my own schedule is a pluss, no money unless surging more money for minutes and waiting!, raise rates in atlanta to $.90 per mile
﻿Not for fulltimers, Flexibility work more or less as you see fit. No boss telling you what to do. Work almost anywhere you want., Rate cuts drunk passengers getting sick on your own vehicle rating system flawed no training. Not good for fulltimers! You must work numerous hours to make money, 
﻿One of the worst predatory companies towards their partners., Money is usually on time other than that the rest is bad. They advertise flexibility but if you want to make any good amount of money you at least have to drive 65+ hours and not sleep on weekends., If you're considering doing Uber Black/SUV in the Houston market think twice. They force you to take Select which pay significantly less many customers already know so they don't bother to get the upgrade Black/SUV upgrade if they can get the same car and chauffeur for way less. At the begging it was a 50-50 spread on Select or Black trips now most of the requests: about 85% of them are Select if you choose not to..., Rectify and consider best business practices listen to the partners not just by stupid words on emails but with actions. Stop predatory and misleading advertisement to attract new partners.

﻿uber - not a good job, Work your own hours. Work when you want to. You are your own boss., Low Pay uber takes as much as 55% of your fare app costs you when it makes mistakes 95% do not tip No way to get questions answered from uber other than very slow responsive and often generic email responses. No phone to call about anything., Raise rates so it covers costs Stop showing surge area when it isn't true Stop stealing rider fee and 25% - leaves $2.48 after fees with a minimum ride where you pay gas maintenence and more. Allow riders to tip. If you are going to take an average of 45% of all driver earnings you should provide better service to drivers including phone contact.
﻿UBEREats, Work...IF you want to. As long as you are invited to do eats you can sign up and work on days that are convenient for you. You get a bonus for making deliveries in inclement weather., You're capped at 3hrs per shift. You MUST have a bicycle (If you live in NYC you can't use a CitiBike apparently) There is no guarantee that they'll have enough food bags for everyone to deliver and make money (however they do credit you $20 for showing up as long as you're signed up for that day) There are days where the scheduled time to check-in would be 10:30am but there would be a lengthy wait for the food..., Increase the no food bonus to $40. Some people commute a long way to make deliveries.
﻿uberX driver, make your own schedule and unlimited brakes, use your car pay more than 40% on tax in the end of the year., Change the pay model for the drivers
﻿Driving For Uber, - You choose your hours. - Great if you like to work with people. - Xchange program provides pretty good leasing options., - Customers arent allowed to tip through the Uber app. - Sometimes you can end up making less than minimum wage and thats BEFORE your expenses. - Have to put up with drunk people some of the time. - Very little outreach from corporate division to us the contracted drivers., - Allow customers to leave a tip through the app. - Initiate a friendlier atmosphere toward drivers and have "team-building" events for contracted drivers(we're people too!).
﻿My Uber review, Mileage on my new vehicle., No Comment., 
﻿Uber don't care for drivers, Company is very popular in New York, Fare are to Low price and not tips, Increase a little more the fare price and cut the uber fee it should be 10% in NYC. Drivers are owners or renters of cars.
﻿Hustle is what we call it!, + Brilliant people you work with + Love the passion that every individual has and brings in + Freedom you get to share ideas and do stuff is awesome + Never worked for a fast paced company like this + If you want a challenging and a meaningful job THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE!, - Things move so fast so you don't get time to relax - Work life balance is skewed - Its a race! Everyone is running! You need to match the pace if not you fail! - Should become more structured, Help employees so they can maintain a WLB Groups should be broken. At the end of the day we are all one team working towards one goal.
﻿Uber Driver, , , 
﻿Bad Company, The company doesn't really care about you once you get to 4.6 your gone so rethink before you buy a car for this job because they wouldn't care about you. all they care about is the money that why they know they can keep hiring new jobs that can do the job for them while the old driver won't last that long. and you be must to the people who even will hurt you and hit you and if you complain that to the company nuermous..., your star rating sucks they will be a better company that is gonna take over you guys one day, 
﻿Inside Sales Rep, , , 
﻿Uber Driver, The good things are your car is not marked like a regular cab so nobody can stop you on the street and ask for a ride you don't deal with payments from riders you choose when to drive., The list is too long this is a brief overview - drivers are badly treated by the company because riders are always right so they can abuse it and occasionally they do that was my experience. And Uber is always on rider's side no matter what. Uber doesn't care about their drivers the only thing they care about is profit drivers generate for them. Their drivers are not their employees but contractors as they say..., I don't care about Uber's management I am just curious to see how long this concept of badly treating your work force can sustain.
﻿Taxi, Work own hours be you're own boss get to meet people you are outside and are able to see what's happening in you're community., Can't make much money. Can't make minimum wage. You drive and maintain your own vehicle and pay for gas. They are stilling from drivers to build business., Charge customers enough so drivers make a livable income. In order to have customers you need drivers. No one can afford to drive their nice vehicle into the ground just so you can make money. Eventually you'll be known for what you're are. Crooks!
﻿Exciting company with the best people, I've never been working in such fast-growing and exciting company! It is an invaluable experience you can working with smart people realize your ideas in life, Yes you need to work hard (and your friends and family will say that you work a lot )  but you will not notice this if you really passionate your work, 
﻿Uber Pool, , , 
﻿Uber Driver, Work whenever you want. Very easy (most of the time), Some riders can be difficult especially if inebriated. Riders rarely tip, 
﻿UBER is an UBER FAIL, The only requirements for this job are to be breathing and have a car and you can be employed by Uber. I can't even think of 20 positive words to say., First Uber customer service is the absolute worst. They give excuse after excuse after excuse why they don't keep their promises. They tax you 25% + $1.70 riders fee so on short trips Uber makes more money off the ride than you did and you're the one using your car gas and time. They offer 'guarantees' if you drive certain hours but the email is written in code and incredibly hard to follow as well as full of..., Uber is too greedy with the fees charged to drivers it is discouraging to know you guys make more money off short trips than I do. Uber customer service is a joke I've been lied to my face at Uber facility I've been lied to and given the runaround via email customer service. Uber should stop making promises they can't keep before someone decides to take legal action.
﻿Not bad for some extra money, You can make your own schedule. If you feel like driving you just open the app click "Go online" and wait for the pings to show up. The pay is decent especially if you drive during peak hours. They typically email you the projected peak hours at the beginning of the week., Driving in the city can be stressful it definitely some getting used to. There is no straightforward way to contact Uber customer service as a driver. You are an independently contracted worker so you receive a 1099 tax form which may mean you will owe taxes during tax season., Create an easier way for drivers to contact customer service. The best way I think would be an online chat support system.
﻿They don't care about their associates or riders, Ability to make own schedule and set own hours. Work when you are available, Fares constantly dropping and surges are only during rush hour and late night weekends, More reasonable guarantees options for notice of were a person is traveling to before you accept the trip.
﻿Could be a lot better could also be worse, Work from home. Fairly flexible schedules. Lots of great remote coworkers to connect with., Training does not fully prepare you for your job. Managers are mostly not in touch with their teams. Often feels like you are on your own to figure everything out., 
﻿Good, $$$$ money is good easy work easy to get approved potential to make a lot not many more pros in my opinion, Corporate doesn't care about employees only about making money taxes suck big time watch out for them uber doesn't withhold taxes, Be more like lyft
﻿Exciting company working hard to change the world, True meritocracy where the best ideas can rise to the top. Dedicated and passionate co-workers. Exciting and fast-paced environment means there is never a dull moment., The ever changing nature of the business can make working at Uber a bit chaotic at times. This is the other side of the exciting nature of the job., Keep up the emphasis on the fastest innovation possible while trying to balance transparency and consistency for employees.
﻿Salary, Love the fact that I can just get in my car and make money and no one is breathing down my neck., The wear and tear on my car and the pay. Uber has reduced the driver's share of the pie to 75% for driver. Gasoline is high here and I'm all over the city it's easy to use a tank of gas which cuts into your take home Customers do not tip., Improve communication with those in the field they keep the company running.
﻿Not a lot of money here, Flexibility you get to meet interesting people all the time. Work life balance is awesome because you pick your hours., The rates for UberX in DFW are absolute garbage. $0.85 a mile and $.10 a minute and we only get 80% of that., Raise rates for established markets
﻿Continously Impressed, You can really see the impact of the work you do and the impact is moving people around cities and better transportation for everyone. It is not everywhere that all the people you work with and inspiring! There are so many different background but everyone has a special something that makes them awesome! Everyone works hard to find the best and creative solutions. Your team is really the best way to learn and be inspired..., Everyone you meet will not tell you their opinion about Uber whether they love it or hate it or have a story about one random trip their third cousin took years ago. It is like being a dentist and everyone showing you they teeth. The amount of work and commitment you have leaves little room for free hours for your extracurriculars., Keep up enforcing the interaction of coworkers. A team that knows eachother and likes eachother will work better together.
﻿Driver partner, Set your own hours. Drive when you want where you want. You can drive mornings evenings weekends or take the week off if you want., No voice in numerous rate reductions. Nasty emails warning of deactivation if you don't accept most ride requests. Can often be in the center of a large surge area and repeatedly get non-surge requests 10 or more minutes away. Get kicked out of the driver app for 10-24 hours for rejecting or canceling rides. Expected to accept UberPool rides even though while every client gets charged a base fare + safety fee the driver..., Stop treating your driver partners like they aren't an important and necessary part of the company business and pay them a decent rate
﻿Community Rep, They are laid back and friendly, Managment doesn't really manage and throws you in. They have also been laying people off to outsource workers.,

﻿Eh..., Flexible schedule work at your own pace, less than minimum wage payouts after taxes and expenses, care for your drivers
﻿Not worth it, Pay went down 300% from when I started. And that was only in three months. Surge went from being robust to almost nonexistent due to an oversaturation of drivers in the marketplace. Uber also has a habit of adding in new fees all the time. When a rider cancels a ride they are charged but the driver does not see any of that money. Hope that uber drivers are able to unionize and get a decent wage., Stop adding in new fees every couple months. Pay drivers a living wage and give them benefits., 
﻿Great Company, Very dynamic people are great, not a lot of structue, 
﻿Driver, Work life balance flexible hours. Pricing system can be lucrative and consistent pay is hard to come by., You do not qualify for benefits as a driver because you're technically not an employee. You also must cover your own costs to operate your company and pay your own taxes., 
﻿DOps, Love the people pace environment. It's a hectic place to work and definitely not for everyone but if you are smart make good decisions and love just getting it done it's a great place to work., Have to be able to deal with uncertainty., Keep it a startup type environment
﻿I love driving Uber., Makes $100 a day., Hurts back after awhile just have to manage that and balance that with gym time., Nothing
﻿Partner support representative, Casual office and a good team, Many psr's are contract workers, 
﻿DOps (OC), - The fastest growing company in the world - The ownership you get while executing your tasks and goals - Working with the top minds and the best calibers in the world, - You work a lot (no work-life balance) - Constant stress - No medical insurance, - Keep Hustling - Some processes need to be streamlined - Open more means of communication between city teams and regions
﻿good for temporary position, Flexible schedule. I enjoyed helping people sign up to become drivers., Constantly changing the payment structure. Very unorganized. Lack of support from admin., Get organize and care about your employees.
﻿Driver, Time flexibility there is work at anytime., To many Drivers rates are getting Low and calls are taking longer since there are too many doing it good for the Headquarters not to good for the employees., They should increase the basic fares too low for the vehicle owners is not becoming a good deal anymore.
﻿Driver, Able to work whenever I please. Pay is decent considering the flexible hours. It's fun to interact with the various people you come into contact with., You have absolutely no benefits. Must pay your own employee tax which results in higher taxes. Must pay for your own gas., I have never spoken to any members of management. They make it very difficult to get a hold of an actual person on the telephone.
﻿Uber Driver, Free to work as you will, Drunks and no work available, Stop taking away the driver's profits
﻿Uber driver, Gives you flexibility to work when ever you want . You have your own schedule . You are your own boss . Get to meet very good people, Uber takes all the money . They say they will keep 20% and give you 80 %. But you actually get only 60% of what you make . And then you have to pay for gas . Wear and tear on your car ., It's a rip off. You guys sucks . You are cheating the driving . All the money driver makes you take . You simple suck
﻿Nielsen, Excellent Company. allows you to grow as an individual. great learning experience, pay is lower than the FMCGs. work hours can be long., 
﻿Good but not best can do better, very passionate less politics in the company move fast. you have the opportunity to change the world and get chance to communicate with different places' people from all around the world., You need to work from morning till midnight everyday don't have personal time don't have time to spend with your family member even don't have time to talk with your kids., Employ more people quickly improve the quality of the food provided in the company.
﻿Garbage, Flexibility. You get to wear your car out at your expense. Who could possibly ask for more?, Wear and tear of your car with your gas and get paid garbage!, Like they give a rat's hind end whatsoever! It's about driving that stock price up as high as possible do principles can dump and live happily ever after. Are you kidding me? This is a business model that will collapse soon. Do the math. If you discount your own time to zero you'll do just fine!
﻿Awesome place to work takes over your life, Smart people doing meaningful and fulfilling work. Good perks lots of opportunities - including abroad. Strong leadership good stock options., Little to no work life balance. Expected to be connected all of the time. Some leadership thinks you need to stay at the office late to be working. Not a lot of upward movement outside of HQ in San Francisco., Keep it up! Overall really strong like the access. Make sure as you continue to grow keep a pulse on ops and the teams that are hustling on the ground every day around the world.
﻿One word - Exciting!, Work is challenging and you're required to work at the best of your potential that keeps you on your toes all the while. Best part? - Your inputs can actually make a difference to the way things are done!, Managing the work-life balance some might find it tough but I find working here a compelling proposition., Keep doing the amazing job and expanding the reach relentlessly.
﻿World Class Oppourtunity, Fast paced environment with incredible people from a wide range of backgrounds. Huge opportunities for learning., Very long hours. Any one considering any position at Uber must be aware of the long hours which can sometime affect the work life balance. A large degree of this is compensated for through an outstanding company culture., Continue to focus on personal and professional development opportunities for employees at all levels.
﻿Driver, Great to have your own business and set your own hours., Miles on car can be a lot, Qui lowering rates
﻿#Superpumped!, The culture. Nothing beats the culture within Uber. You will seriously know how it feels to work with best of the best., The only thing we find difficult with Uber is when we run out of ideas. We think of the most creative and logical ideas and it's so frustrating when you have thought of almost everything., Keep the culture going. Continue the creativity. And strive more for motivation and inspiration. Because sometimes front line soldiers sometimes need a pat on the back.
﻿No respect for drivers, There is no good reason to work for Uber as an independent contractor., Everything is about money. no respect for people who made uber 'Uber'. Keep lowering the prices and keep increasing their commission., Have some values!!!
﻿Couldn't be happier here!, Honest fast paced company. Never a dull moment and always learning!, Because Uber is a startup patience with the company is in order...but it's worth it in the long run., 
﻿Driver, easy money no bosses. You get to make your own schedules sign in whenever you want., you have to self-motivate constantly weekly payouts and spare time inbetween rides., 
﻿Good place to work and grow, Excellent work environment which keeps you on your toes all the time, Life work balance could be an issue, All looks good however work life balance may need some tinkering
﻿Uber Driver, Good Customer Service For Clients., No Phone Number For Customer Service Center., 
﻿uber driver partner, Provide service to VIP clients maintain a clean vehicle, downtime traffic, 
﻿UBER FAST MONEY, Great surge charges when holidays snow storms rain, if no surge charge going on not worth the money my car is a v6 and i had done rides of 15 mins for $4 I waste more on gas., 
﻿Valuable first job, Everyone is extremely intelligent passionate and hard working. I'm learning new skills every day that I will be able to use in the future and pushing myself by being surrounded by talented individuals. People are always willing to help you if you have any questions. Everyone is friendly and fun and you really feel appreciated. Because it's in a hyper-growth phase right now there is always more to do and work on...., Work life balance can get a little crazy. I have spent a few late nights at the office (latest was 4am one night). While the management encourages to get a good amount of sleep each night they also stress for employees to find their "Red Lines" and to push themselves past that if possible. I am all for improvement but I don't know if more time spent will really have better results. It seems as though time spent is worn..., While we're in an insane growth phase it is still important to give ownership to new employees and help them grow.
﻿Driver, Flexibility is the best part about being a driver at a Transportation Community Network company. The money can be good and you meet a lot of great people driving., Poor driver support was a problem. It was difficult and often took several days for anyone to respond and to solve or answer a question., It would be great to feel as if the position of driver was not something that was somehow looked down upon given that without them the company would not exist (at lease until autonomous cars come into play)
﻿Community Operations Specilaist, New workplace Newer opportunities Good atmosphere Proper operations Mix of culture very well, Too early to comment Many policies and positions need to be created, 
﻿They have you by your uber., Flexibility meet new people interesting change of pace see the city., Pau is low then take out for gas insurance and wear and tear the even lower. Surge is sometimes a myth., Higher pay no discounted fares that count against drivers
﻿Okay, You get to meet and work with a lot of cool people. Pretty relaxed work environment., Weekly schedules are unpredictable and you may end up having to work every single weekend., 
﻿Terrible terrible place, Have smart engineers nice office, But terrible terrible management Bad lunch and late dinner, 
﻿They dont care about the drivers, The pay is way under what they advertise they are taking 25% now paying less per mile asking passengers not to tip. They really dont help us in any way., You're making millions thanks to our work respect the drivers give them a better chance to make money., 
﻿Amazing place to work!, - Amazing and caring co-workers - Bold and extremely impactful mission - Great place to put your skills to the test in a fast-paced environment that challenges everyone, - Lots of great ideas leads us to perhaps take on too many projects as once,

﻿Uber, Work your own schedule., No benefits Uber takes 25-30% of commision Uber help assistance needs to be better., Treat your drivers more like employees than an App.
﻿Driver, Helping people from one destination to another, You offer up your car to the riders, 
﻿Fast paced and ever moving., Makes you feel like you are part of the team you can actually see that everything is growing around you. This makes you feel invested in what you are doing to help the company., The repetitiveness can take its toll with some long days. Keeping motivated on a daily basis can be a challenge some days., Continue to work hard. They have been a valuable source of information and motivation to keep me going.
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule is a pro., Rates are dropping so harder to make money., Please increase rates to make driving a sustainable job.
﻿Remote Community Support, , , 
﻿Great for Riders.....Drivers not so much, Work your own hours...Yada Yada Yada, The compensation is horrible......Being a 1099 contract job I believe at expenses the IRS would consider this job a hobby, Pay the people the facilitate your income....
﻿good environment, great star-up to expand your potential and lead a team even as an intern nice boss and good schedle, everything is so new there so we have to start from scratch again may not be able to keep up with all the new regulations, care more about how to develop intern well and give them the potential through well-designed intern program
﻿Good for side gig, The best part about uber is the flexibility you get to pick when and where you drive and its up to you to find the hotspots., there is a lot of down time when its slow. There isn't any room to grow asa driver you're just a driver., keep it up. this company has expanded for a reason you provide a great service. Please continue to help our drivers as much as possible
﻿Uber Driver, Uber is a great opportunity if you are out of work and need money ASAP. It allows you to work at your own pace and set your own schedule. Pay is 75% of fares completed through the Uber App... And is direct deposit weekly with no pay hassles. You can also choose who you will pick up and where you will go., Uber drivers must have their own vehicles insurance and proper registration. You must also keep up maintenance on your vehicle. Money for gas expense is out of pocket and since you are only paid direct deposit midweek at times it is hard to manage or budget since you only have a one time payout and are unaware of future fares and their expenses. Your private insurance also will not cover any accidents or incidents..., provide limited insurance coverage and a gas card for deduction from pay account.
﻿Great schedule everything else sucks, I was able to start and stop driving whenever I wanted, I paid for all maintainence and gas; the work was dull; my account was deactivated after about a year because my driver rating had fallen too low but Uber would not even hint as to why that was (I never failed to be on time and polite with passengers and none of them ever complained to me). Instead I was told I needed to pay $60 for a refresher course after which Uber would "consider" reactivating my account. I..., Improve the app so the driver knows exactly where to go. Be more forthcoming with information. And a company worth $50 Billion should be able to give a little compensation for gas and repairs (as I think food delivery services do).
﻿Marketing, The company at a whole is a fast pace creative and high potential company to be a part of. Everyday you see new products being created to tackle some of the biggest problems in the world. It's hard to deny the talent that this company attracts and the best part is a company like this comes once in a lifetime., When people say you work a lot you really do here. However I would rather much say this place is all about hustle which is how much do you really want it. Even though I have slotted this under as a con you might feel as if this is the type of environment you want to be a part of., 
﻿Driver UberX- good, work your own schedule make good money low stress good work life balance no micromanagement user friend portals paid weekly, contract 1099 end of the year taxes are tough drive your own car certain areas can have more legal hoops to jump through sometimes it is hard to get in touch with someone when you need something quickly not a lot of training live or die by reviews best hours for the most money are going to be drinking times no benefits, 
﻿pretty cool, work on your own time meet loads of cool people holiday surge price, people can be rude mileage in car gas prices get a hybrid, 
﻿Great Company!, You'll meet some of the most driven and ambitious people here. Really exciting company with lots of new things going on all the time. Plenty of opportunities to get involved! Overall just inspiring company trying to change transportation!, Long hours (but I'd say comparable to other tech/startups and other jobs). The job is what you make it- you hit the ground running and expectations are high!, 
﻿Uber is cheating new driver, Rider and Uber management is happy, Uber take 25% from driver I drive my car average earned is about $17 per hour it is not coverd gas and vehicle cost., 
﻿Uber Driver, Flexible hours. Good part-time., Low income (less than minimum wage after expenses) Horrible driver support with automated responses that have nothing to do with original question and support staff who can't read. No tip option for passengers. Unpredictable. Company keeps reducing fares and saturating market with drivers which make it impossible to make a profit. Uber wouldn't exist without the drivers but they treat us like an expendable commodity., Add a tipping feature to the app and have more responsive driver support
﻿Contract Driver, Set your own hours. Paid weekly., -They slash fare prices during the slowest times of the years (January and August). Drivers might make the same but that is only because they are putting in more hours. -No tipping function in the app. Uber lies to customers stating tipping is included into the fare calculation (it isn't). -If a passenger takes too long to get ready the Driver can cancel the ride after 5 minutes and receive a $5 late fee. However..., Stop trying to squeeze the margins. It seems as if there will a moment real soon where driver burnout + bad word of mouth = no drivers. Most other Drivers I've spoken to prefer using Lyft but Uber is marginally better. However with each fare cut those margins are starting to disappear.
﻿Uber Partner, Great learning experience about local attractions and different businesses people are involved with., Application errors and not being able to please everyone., I would like to know what is actually updated when a new driver and software build is installed when I update my application.
﻿UberX driver, Flexible schedule You could work as much as you want, Hardly making minimum wage at the end.....STAY AWAY OR YOU'LL REGRET AT THE END. SENSELESS COMPANY FLOODING THE STREETS WITH DRIVER!!! They only care about their pockets. UBER = SLAVERY OF 21st Century, STOP SCREWING YOUR OWN WORKERS THEY PAY YOUR SALARIES
﻿Love it, Being able to work whenever I want. The money is great. I get to spend more time with my family., Not being able to work when it snowing. People throwing up in your car., 
﻿awesome, weekly payment fast money good ppl, you have to pay your own tolls, pay the tolls
﻿Career Advancement, Great Uber credits benefits for all staff!, Needs more career advancement guidelines option for all levels, Focus more on the people who is at the front line.
﻿Freedom, The ability to work on your own hours can be a great opportunity. I also get to meet some great people., Passengers that are intoxicated can be troublesome and I have had a few passengers vomit in my car in the past few months. Paying for my own insurance vehicle repairs and gas can add up quickly and make driving for Uber not worth it., 
﻿cheaper driver, liberty peacefull great for second job part-time., the rates are very lower. You expand too much time to make a short money., 
﻿The best tech company to work with, I work with the best people when my recruiter told me about this I kinda doubt his statement. But when I joined I was amazed by how smart and talented all the people in the company. You will meet the best people in all industry in the world I'm not kidding!! Everyday you will feel that you are truly blessed to be a part of the talented people in the company. Therefore you will learned A LOT. I learned a lot. From..., Long working hours no weekend which is no secret and they openly shared to you since the recruitment phase. Stressful with high pressure on the job definitely not for the weak., More open on the new candidate during the recruitment (about the benefits etc). More clear system especially on the finance support for the employees.
﻿Great for part time, Set your own hours any time you want to work, No real protection from some issues, 
﻿Uber partner driver, Choose your own hours. Pay checks are automatically deposited to your checking account on a weekly basis. Easy to use app., Uber keeps cutting driver's rates to attract more riders (their claim). Because of this Uber drivers no longer make any profit but only create cash-flow instead. As an example I had to drive 5 miles to pick someone up to drive them 2 miles. My cut was $2.21 AFTER Uber took their fees and had to drive another 5 miles home. Not even close to being worth it. Uber management claims that drivers will make more money..., Restore rates back to the pre-January cut. Not once did a customer complain about the rates they were paying. They were very happy I could pick them up in a fraction of the time that it would take a taxi to get them and at a fraction of the cost of a taxi. If I had to use Uber as a regular rider I would find another way to get to my destination as a result of the fewer drivers available as there's no guarantee I...
﻿Good and bad, You can make your own schedule good for extra cash passengers are generally pretty respectful., With the pay cuts it is often not worth driving once calculating wear and tear on car and gas., Stop cutting rates it is good for passengers but makes it much tougher for drivers to make good money. Many drivers are going to stop driving at this point.
﻿going downhill, You can set your own hours., They keep cutting the pay for the drivers. In some cities you get less than the $.55/mile that the government says it costs to use a car. A once good job that has turned bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, Act like a normal company company and stick with reasonable prices and reasonable pay. Stop "experimenting" with peoples lives!!!!!!!!!!!
﻿Empty Promises, Fun fast-paced company Work with incredibly smart people Free food!, Unlimited vacation days are offered as a benefit but looked down on when you take them. The wrong people are placed in management roles. The company doesn't actually care about their people. Management promises one thing and turns around and does something completely different. Their excuse is always "that's Uber"., 
﻿Driver, It is hard to mention the pros because there are none. This company is a law breaking lying disgusting entity., Poor payment structure that only goes downward. Rate cuts with emails telling drivers how they'll make more in volume. Surge pricing is a scam to drivers and riders alike. Underhanded dirty political organization that follows one of the biggest con artists of all time. Steal money from drivers accounts based upon fraudulent passenger complaints. If you are considering driving for this criminal organization run don't..., Start with being truthful in your advertising for drivers. Follow up by admitting you are a transportation company and abiding by local regulation. Lose the stupid surge pricing. Stop playing games with drivers pay. Admit without the people who actually own and drive their cars often illegally on your behalf are the lifeblood and without them your app would do nothing.
﻿UberX Driver, Uber keeps lowering fares making margins extremely low. They refuse to put an option to tip. Make false claims that drivers can make $20 per hour. This job is a $12 per hour job full time once you make adjustments for gas depreciation on vehicle taxes etc., Stop cutting fares. People take UberX because they like a cleaner more friendly version of a cab. Your tagline is "Everyone's private driver" not "the cheapest ride possible". Offer classes on some ways to manage expenses and revenues. Many drivers I've talked to think the $17-$20 they gross an hour is their take home., 
﻿Great Opportunity...If You Work Right Areas and Times, The pros are numerous but here are just a few: - Great pay if you work during high-demand times - Make your own hours and work location (anywhere in the state you're licensed to drive in) - Low overhead req's (auto insurance service maintenance car registration etc.) - Lots of tax deductions from business-related expenses (you're the boss in this position), Biggest downsides are as follows: - Weekly driver app "upgrades" don't always work; some issues take several weeks to solve - Extreme hours required to take advantage of all high-demand times - Customers can be messy rude or even violent at times - Support staff and managers ignore improvement suggestions from drivers - Little to no CSR (corporate social responsibility) attitude(s)/action(s) embedded in company..., - Suggestions from drivers should be taken into consideration - Newest features on driver app are great but don't put off adding the most needed ones - Programmers consistently seem to cut corners in order to release a new version each week - Support staff not on the same page as technical staff at times; cross-communication needs to be improved
﻿Plethora of tedious (simple) work false promises from management, Usually a steady schedule flexible hours decent pay for the job. Diverse coworkers. Lunches and drinks. Lots of free time., Incredibly hard to get anywhere higher up unless you have an "in" or fit perfectly into the office ambience. Many referrals created clique type feelings. There is a feeling of divide between the contracted employees and (for lack of better word) "official" employees. Was asked many times to go against city compliances (there are many regulations Uber must oblige to and they request their employees to bend stretch or..., Care about your employees. Care about your drivers too! The only people that do are the employees working directly with the drivers but those are the employees you treat like sh!t.
﻿Personal Driver, You work when you want wherever you want, Some days are really slow and you could work for hours before you even make $20. You pay for your own gas and maintenance and insurance. Uber doesn't cover anything., As long as Drivers are logged on they should always get an hourly guarantee because sometimes it is very difficult to earn any decent money when you are only making $3-8$ on trips.
﻿Incredible culture and team, Uber's application process is extremely rigorous but once hired you find out why. I've never been around more driven capable people in my life. There's an incredible feeling of teamwork and shared commitment that permeates everything we do. If you're willing to work hard "step on toes" and be creative Uber will empower you with all the responsibility you can handle. The perks are great—catered lunch tons..., It's not a 9-5 job—very much an "all hands on deck" culture. If you're not ready to fight for what you believe in the environment could overwhelm you., 
﻿wow, Only for the riders none for drivers get used and abused and lied to by corporate ............, They lie to employees about hourly guarentee and have a non tip policy when it's a doller a mile for drivers. Awful, 
﻿Driver, Give you flexibility and that's it I guess that's it but is it pros - for someone, Bad behavior low salary no tips - they will lure you first into the company will make you to finance expensive car and then you are trapped, You have to think before doing something!
﻿Poor Treatment of American CSRs, Working remotely and working with some good and talented people., Sending American jobs offshore (for lower cost and sub par quality) dishonesty about our prospects lack of transparency and lack of respect. Many of us were hired as Uber employees then we were transferred to another company to work for Uber on a contract basis. Uber hired some great people to build their support team remotely. Unfortunately they were unappreciative of all of our hard work and they replaced us with..., It's too late now.
﻿Cool company growing global impact, -autonomy -ability to build process programs -great onboarding program, -not so much a con but just a note if you're coming from a company that's pretty established this will be a change, 
﻿Tred Carefully, The flexibility is not to be found anywhere else., Contracts and pay rates change with no notice., Manage the expectations of your contractors so they can plan better and you will have less dissatisfactions.
﻿They care only about results - they'll fire new people if not to standards, Everyone is super smart and things get done very quickly., Uber is an aggressive company - all that matters is results no matter how you get there. Work 70 hours step on toes doesn't matter. There is NO training. If you're new you have to figure everything out and if you mess up you get blamed. There is a common practice of firing people after 2 months if they can't figure things out or keep up. They do NOT give any warnings or feedback even if you ask for it. Work-life..., Don't fire your employees without giving them an explanation of their performance and a chance to improve. Invest in your employees as much as the product and care about their career growth. Realize that new employees need time to learn - throwing them into the gauntlet is not the right way to run a company.
﻿Great place to develop and thrive!, Uber gives incredible opportunity to grow so rapidly and in so many ways there is no other place to compare it with. Incredible fast paced environment where everything changes before you get use to it. Senior Management shares vision with entire team giving everyone place to improve life of the whole company., Late hours a lot of things to do might be a problem to people with families., Keep it up with hiring the best guys out there!
﻿driver, i worked at uber and it was fun because i worked on weekends at night so i got to see a lot of drunk people and a hear a lot of fun stories, the payments werent so well and the safety wasnt either because where i live there was too many violence with the cabs so i left the company, i dont advice anything as a driver but as a rider i would adviser to have prepared drivers because sometimes they get lost

﻿Gotta Love People & Driving, Good to see what your paid after each trip and for the day. Meet great people. Get to see the city., wear-and-tear on the car. Drunk guests., More bonuses. Gas cards etc.
﻿Great place to work, Great culture (of course based on team) but I don't see much difference in how teams operate. No managerial crap like big companies (even though Uber has grown out of being a startup) Things move really fast if you used to working in big companies on your own pace and chilled out environment Uber might end up being your nightmare. Higher management is very good and know what they are doing and have better planning..., Base salaries are pretty less compared to most big companies (because its a pre IPO company), 
﻿So-So, Flexible Meet interesting people Good money during peak hours, Overall low payouts Non-peak hours are not worth driving Wear and tear on your vehicle takes a bite out of the income, Raise the rates increase payouts or compensate drivers for their vehicle expenses
﻿Money losing proposition, Flexible Hours Be your own boss, No longer able to make a profit on most rides after Ubers latest rate cut for drivers After factoring the depreciation on your car plus all other operating expenses most drivers are now operating at a loss.Was an okay way to make a little money on the side when driving at the old rates but that is no longer feasible.Dealing with their outsourced customer service was very frustrating and often a waste of time as well., Raise the rates so drivers can make a profit.
﻿A crazy ride, The smart people at Uber are the *smartest* people. The work is always exciting. The product is something you use every day., Super aggressive culture not diverse many executives lacking basic social graces hiring too fast has resulted in lower caliber of employees in some parts of company, 
﻿Uber, , , 
﻿Very good one, Good money and free food., Too many engineers so quickly., Good way to go.
﻿Hustle - At What Cost?, Lots of responsibility - if you have a good idea and sell it well nobody will stop you from going out there and doing it Leverage - the Uber brand name gives you access to all kinds of companies and individuals, There is a huge gap in pay and benefits between interns/consultants and permanent employees which is not proportionate to the work hours you have to put in - 13 14 even 15 hour work days are not uncommon they're the norm., Uber was built on a meritocratic culture and strong ethics - please preserve these values before they totally slip away
﻿CSR, Work from home was great and the pay was okay, They let go of the majority of USA work at home just before Christmas and are now outsourcing 99% of the work to the Philippines., None
﻿Great work rough salary, There is really great work and benefits here including insurance food and snacks, The salary is really rough about 50% less than what you would get at other companies with twice the work, Cut the overhired head count and up the pay for those who work hard
﻿Is what you make it, , , 
﻿Convnenient part time job but. . ., If you are a college student or if you need to make extra money this is THE gig to fill as you make your own hours on your time and not Uber's. In other words no one will tell you when to work or clock out., Uber is very driver unfriendly of late. If you are rated "below average" all Uber does is give a general list of things to improve your rating WITHOUT SPECIFIC CRITICISMS from riders., If you want drivers to maintain above average ratings you need to give SPECIFIC CRITICISMS OR COMMENTS ABOUT THE BELOW AVERAGE RATINGS of the week in question. I brought this up to my local Uber support and all they cited was "Feedback from specific riders aren't disclosed to partners for privacy reasons." Well then DO NOT POST THE RIDER'S NAME" What is hard about that?
﻿Good for a time but pay will always fall, Choice of when an where you are willing to work paid every week never talk to a manager or another employee., Take home pay will deflate through time, Good luck paying back your investors
﻿Avoid at all cost, flexibility in your schedule. It helps get to job interviews. You also can meet other people that can help you find a real job and network., pay seems great at first. But "earnings" is not an accurate representation of "profit". They are deceiving people and taking advantage of them. The pay is not even minimum wage but it does make for a little extra spending cash. Very little extra spending cash. No tips because .90 cents a mile covers the tip on their eyes. Don't forget they are taking 25% of that .90 and all the expenses are on your shoulders. Gas..., Good luck in the future law suits. Actually no I hope they bleed you dry and please go to France so they can arrest you as you are illegally operating in the country.
﻿No One Cares About Drivers. Don't Drive For UBER., None. It's nice to be called a "Partner" but you are not tested like one so forget that too. I would say a flexible schedule but it's become about being able to lose money at your convenience., No tipping in the app. They say you don't have to tip. Well where is anyone required to top? They also play word games lying to customers that tips are included. No. No they aren't., You are putting all of your effort into six figure salaries and benefits for software engineers and administrators while giving them the farm while your drivers languish in ever increasing poverty. Never have I seen a more overly entitled crass company in all of my life. Let your drivers earn a decent rate. Give them something of benefit. I bet if you go public you won't even award them stock....... Fire your CEO. He...
﻿I finally found my dream career, The biggest pro is that even as Uber grows as a company it remains an organization run by owners at every level. As an owner I'm entrusted enabled and empowered to drive the business forward in the best way I see fit. I don't have to wait for rounds and rounds of alignment. This means I can just be be a creative problem solver and don't have to worry about what happens if an idea fails. The goal is to test something..., Everyone (correctly) talks about the hours. I used to work a true 9-5 and I have a wife so previously work-life balance was important to me but that was because my work was unfulfilling. I love the work I'm doing now and don't count the hours since I'm working on problems that I'm personally interested in solving. As the company scales and gains efficiencies I can see some of the hours reduce. The salary was a step..., The core business is the obvious innovation but what you've done from a company culture standpoint is the true hidden gem. It wouldn't be possible without the cultural values that are part of every Uber employee. As we grow continue to be a disruptor not just in the core business but in HR as well!
﻿Extra Money, No schedule needed whenever you want to work you can work. No one is your boss you are your own boss., There is no fix money to rely on sometimes you can make 20 dollars an hour but the other time it wont be 10., You can take Uber as your secondary Job but not as a primary job to run house. not reliable good to make some extra cash
﻿Driver, People think that since they have an Uber app they are entitled to a professional driver and a car at there disposal at all times an that the driver is their employee. The rate cuts are a breach of contract for the drivers who took out sub-prime loans to pay for car. The corporate culture has figured out a way to mine human assets and suck the wealth out of the willing participants of which I am no longer one., Less than minimum wage. Ridiculous Promises of income. Restructured sort of a Ponzi that requires a constant influx of new drivers to replace the drivers that figure it out right away., People don't fit into your Algorithms all of the time. Sometimes figures lie and liars figure. If I am your "partner" why are you the only ones making money? You have also way overestimated the intelligence of the average user.
﻿Community Support-Outsourced our jobs!, Opportunity to work from home ability to work independently excitement in working and promoting cutting edge technology and services., Many of us were very excited to get in on what we were told was a ground floor opportunity with a growing technology based company. How disappointing to find that we were to be treated as "temps" for a long term assignment with no paid benefits vacation or any of the perks of a typical employee. Most of our direct managers are so wet behind the ears that they appear never to have actually managed people before and..., It is probably too late at this time as the work from home CSRs probably have limited time left on the job- but hire some mature seasoned managers and adding a few real trainers to the staff would be an excellent idea as well. Treating workers that are under a contractual position like valued members of the team and throwing them a few of the perks and courtesies extended to real employees would foster much more goodwill...
﻿Uber treats its employee bad and makes outrageous money., I could choose when I wanted to work. Paid weekly., Drunk unruly riders. No tips. Car trashed by drunks. Surges are bogus they are gone by time you get there. The process for any issues is hit and miss. Uber really does not answer promptly when an issue occurs. The process in Houston TX to certify to drive for Uber is outrageous very costly time consuming and not worth it. The wear and tear on your car depreciates your car value and Uber does not assist with..., Treat drivers that made your company what it is better.
﻿Low rates = low pay, Flexible hours but cant say much else positive about it. Plan on working on average for 3 to 4 dollars an hour., Buy your gas wash your car and drive around for 5 hours....bring home 16 bucks...minus gas and wash just lost money and time, Pay scale is way off. Anyone logged in for 4 to 5 hours should make more than 16 bucks. Last couple of weekends have just been a waste of time fss and money.
﻿Need to get organized in emerging Mkts, Great app that helps thousands of people. Vibrant and enthusiastic young worker base in the corporate office, They don't think long term. happy go lucky. Dont really think things through, insert senior leadership in every city
﻿Great experience, Flexible working hours good pay excellent customer service and support to drivers., More updates to the app is necessary as to knowing the riders drop off point before starting the trip., More restricted rules to riders to prevent last minute cancellation and clear rule to being charged if riders mess up the drivers car
﻿Driver, Own hours. Flexible. That's about it, Pay is not what's it's cracked up to be. At first it was okay but Uber is taking out sometimes 50% and over 50% of your gross fares. Not to include we still have to pay taxes at the end of the year. Most drivers are barely clearing minimum wage. Uber drivers can no longer make a living working with uber. The hours are your own but you end working more than 8 hours a day to bring home less than $500 a week sometimes...., Pay your drivers what they deserve. You guys take nearly 300 from a gross fare of 600. Uber drives can rarely make a living this way. Most times are unable to even get to surge areas in time to get higher rates. What was once a great company to work for has now become stressful and Unaccommodating to say the least. To keep drivers happy uber needs to pay better or you will see a loss in your partners and possibly...
﻿Driver position, Be your own boss. Anytime you can work., No Tip option. Cutting 25% fee from driver which is higher than Lyft., Add Tip option please and lower fee
﻿Driving Partner, Flexible schedule yet you have to work Friday and Saturday nights to decent money., Can not make a living. 4 pay cuts since I started. $1000/week is now $400 before gas, You won't listen anyways...
﻿Drivers get less and less...the top gets more and more., Anyone notice that nearly ALL the positive comments are from the top management positions? Don't they sound SO similar? Almost rehearsed. Maybe they're forced to make positive reviews or some employee writes them all. Free food drinks perks transportation vacations etc. Notice how the drivers' reviews are starkly different from what the management has to say? It's obvious the top gets everything and give the..., Uber is a ponzi scheme. Drivers get NOTHING. Your pay level has been cut three times in slightly over a year. Uber ENCOURAGES no tipping! Wear and tear on your car will cut it's life in half. You get NO perks unless you bring in more drivers. That means less work for you. You are SO expendable because Uber knows they can find another dupe to drive. You have to drive between 6pm to 2am Thursday through Sunday..., You've either forgotten who actually makes your company successful or you intentionally set it up as an "expendable work force" at the driver level. Even your mid-management level has figured out they can be replaced by outsourcing work here in the U.S. to foreign countries. You're too cheap to reward the people who actually do the real work that has made your company great. What ever happened to the the $28 or $20...
﻿Driver, Independence flexibility and meeting many people, expenses and vulnerability. Living far from an area of high driving fares, Make more possibility to get rides going in a certain direction.
﻿Partner Driver, Work your own hours, Pay scale to low for Work/Balance, 
﻿Jaymula25, , , 
﻿Uber give us personal independence an opportunity to show ourselves how disciplined we are to produce our income., Own schedule own boss weekly pay no cash money handling., Once in a while you drive several miles to pick-up client while his destination is in short., Make it worth for drivers who use to take every single ride the miles they drive to serve our clients.
﻿Who is writing these reviews?, Come and go as you please as a driver. Work whenever you want. Meet a lot of cool people., Uber is a lot of smoke and mirrors. They'll exaggerate things and lie to your face. They never take the driver into consideration when making changes. Arm yourself you never know what type of situation you'll end up in., Hire an advisory board of current drivers stop making decisions from behind a desk and actually communicate with the actual drivers. Stop ignoring the fact that 95% of the drivers are not properly insured and offer advise on how to become properly insured. Insurance isn't even available in some states but Uber doesn't care. Their opinion is "it's not my problem".
﻿Uber support rep, Pay and self scheduling process, Outsourcing overseas reps and firing USA reps, Stop outsourcing
﻿Low pay, Work on your own. Set your own schedule. Meet some really cool people., As more drivers sign up in a gjven area the rates - and your commission - drops. The wear and tear on your car is high. You pay for the gas. Typical insurance policy will NOT cover you while working., Keep the rates up over $1 per mile and $.20 per minute at a minimum.
﻿Personal Driver, Work only when you want to. No boss no coworkers no minimum requirement. Meet lots of interesting people. Cash tips sometimes., Passengers have no respect for your vehicle. The best hours to work are after the bars get out and dealing with drunk people isn't for everyone., There is no way to reach management tech support or customer support except through email. I would suggest having a phone contact.
﻿Driver, Complete flexibility. Work whatever hours are convenient for you., Ever changing rates and never for the better., Add a tip function to the app!
﻿Driver, Work hours that you want. Meeting people of all walks of life., No direct contact with company., Have a way to look at destination of rider before pick up is accepted.
﻿Perfect for my situation., I determine when I work and for how long. Pay is fair enough., It seems as though there are times I sit idle too long. If I had to do this full time it probably wouldn't be worth it. LOTS of hours and miles would be needed to make enough money., PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE create a driver's hotline so we can get instant answers or advice on situations that develop on the road.
﻿Dream Job Dream Company, Uber is like the company that I'd always wanted to work for without knowing it. The company really values its employees. Also my coworkers are smart passionate and very hard working. The perks are top notch. Mostly everyone has the attitude that they will roll up their sleeves and do what it takes to get the job done. Also the company is growing so fast that things are never the same day to day and you get to work..., A lot of people say work life balance is an issue at Uber. I think it varies by role. I have never had an issue with it though and I am always extremely busy with projects. You just need to learn how to disconnect from time to time. Also if you love your job it won't matter that you work extra hours. My biggest con would be that as we get bigger there is starting to be more bureaucracy. I think there have been some..., As we grow please continue to be fierce in hiring the right people to fit our culture. It's hard to keep super high standards when we need more staff so badly but it's worth it in the long run.
﻿Slave labor, You get to make your own schedule., Hidden fees taking bigger cuts unexpectedly saturating the market so you get less fares lowering rates no tip option. Uber "partner" assistance is non existent. I have sent them questions months ago that they haven't addressed yet. Uber is Mr. Burns evil. It saddens me because it's such a great idea that is just tarnished by greedy businessmen., Raise fares tip option better partner assistance STOP IT WITH THE HIDDEN FEES!!!
﻿Great place to work, - Really fascinating technical challenges. - The company of incredibly smart and driven people. - Very open culture that encourages independence., - The lunch options at the office are pretty underwhelming, 
﻿Good place to work, make your own hours no gossiping co workers, you never know when you will have a good or bad week pay could be higher, consider changing your percentage we are the ones giving the rides and the wear and tear on my car
﻿A driver's account of a careless relationship!!, NO Boss NO schedule NO uniform mandated by a corporation.

A great filler while looking for the right Career move and fit for longevity.

As a driver; there are NO added driver benefits tiny retail discounts that you have to qualify..., I think you grew too big too fast you left out the Drivers....you're focus is more internal employees than external revenue makers...I'm curious are the COO and CEO going out to drive too for the experience; you know get a feel for the real job of building Uber from the outside in!?!? A real company Leader has done all jobs from the bottom to the top...what's your deal with care and relationships with your Drivers...
﻿Terrible pay and no tip option, Be a slave for 50 cents a mile! Pay ubers taxes because they don't!!!!, What is there to dislike about losing money?, 
﻿Operations & Logistics Manager, All what I loved from my previous professional experiences is now all wrapped together here at Uber: I used to be an architect and urban planner and I found maps beautiful designs and awesome data visualisations everywhere. I used to be a consultant and I found the best ppt slides strong data and MECE arguments all over. I used to work in the development field and my work now is positively impacting and changing society..., Mmmm.... the only cons I can find is not having had the chance to join Uber before. Do it!

﻿PSR, Great work mates nice office and good team vibe (amongst the contractors at least) and good chance to work for an innovative company., Lack of communication and feedback minimal training questionable business practices and ethics., Stop exploiting follow due process and treat people with the respect they deserve.
﻿Uber driver, Flexible schedule that you make yourself, It is dangerous and the compensation is not there. You don't make money after paying gas and other driving expenses, 
﻿It's pretty much a Ponzi scam, Flex schedule. I need a minimum of 20 letters but there are no more pros. A year or so ago a lot of the drivers were not low lives like they ALL are now. Is that a "pro?", After driving a short time drivers begin to realize that they are actually losing money by working for Uber. The new lower pay rates have made this more apparent than ever. Every driver I know quit after a few months at most except the real dummies who fell for the Uber lease program and are now trapped. Instead of trying to retain good drivers they keep treating them like crap and recruit like crazy., Redeem your options as soon as you are able. This company is on a course toward failure. It's a shame as it had the potential to be truly revolutionary.
﻿Operations & Logistics Manager, high ownership extremely smart people around you lot of autonomy at work high business exposure good transparent + flat org., poor work-life balance long hours+pressure = not for the faint hearted off late confused org. structure, The Indian Management needs to be clearer on organisation objectives + Culture is being affected under the reorg - need swift action to retain pre-global summit culture.
﻿So easy so flexible so great!, Work whenever you want as long as you want. Meet cool people (some celebs) engage with clients and get them stoked on Uber (if they weren't already). Uber drivers are the heroes our cities deserve but not the one they need right now..., You feel like a vigilante sometimes with all the taxi drivers and police constantly on the prowl., 
﻿Driver, Extremely flexible hours work as long as little as you want. Pretty quick and easy money depending on the times you work., Must have a fuel efficient car for it to be worth it. I drive a Jetta and live in Texas where the gas is almost as cheap as it gets so it works out pretty well in that department. Putting miles on your car can definitely add up pretty quick especially if you are commuting to a larger city from a small one., 
﻿It used to be great... now its really hard to make good money., - work when you want - stress free - you are your own boss, - very low pay now; before you could make $20- $30/hr now you can only make up to $15/hr you would be lucky if you made more and remember you have to cover up for gas gum toll etc expenses - pay is low because fares are lower than ever - Uber is becoming the new "Wal-Mart" in the transportation business they want to be very cheap - their support team is terrible no matter what the situation is it takes them 1-2..., Keep lowering your fares and you'll lose the last bit of good drivers you had.
﻿Amazing environment, Work in a team of ambitious intelligent fun and creative people No two days are the same The perks! Use creative thinking to overcome problems, You can't just switch off at a weekend - anything could happen!, 
﻿UberX Driver, Love the riders and the schedule. You can stack hours to make money but actual take home sucks and you beat the shyt out of your vehicle. It makes sense if you can network while driving for some other business. Uber takes $2 per ride plus 20% off trhe top so short rides are for squat while risking traffic citations and hazards. I love the job but the pay sucks., It's become a desperation goto job for older people. Great for Uber to penetrate the older demographic b word of mouth but terrible for drivers. LA has become a nearly no - surge town. Weekend nights are the time to make money but trade off is minimum wage sometimes less and with the luck of some good rides you can do ok., Uber is taking too much and driver behavior is changing to stay within a short distance of home. It's really a minimum wage job or less with the beating the car takes. You can futz with hours but only looking at time driven with riders does not convey the time worked.
﻿The embodiment of all things positive and negative that go with working for a startup, Incredibly vibrant energy. Very intelligent people who are mostly younger. Those with experience are coming from very impressive companies. Fantastic benefits., Long hours. Constant pressure to put the rest of your personal life on the back burner to put company first. Poor communication between departments at times., Let employees have a life outside of the job and don't admonish those who need to make personal needs ahead of work from time to time.
﻿Make money? Excuse me ?, There is only one good thing Customer Service and Flexible work hours.. That's all. If you wanna get good job better work with Taco Bell or Walmart., Fares  payment  unprofessional.. Uber doesnt care Drivers ! They promise $500+ Week. Not even close. They Hired many Drivers ! Drop Price ! basically  you are working $7 or 8/hrs after calculate Your car payment + Gas + Insurance.. Not worth it !, Terrible Company strategy !
﻿30% Percent Commission=$1 a mile gross, Great people ride with UBER., UBER takes 30% right away from each fare leaving you with a gross of 70% once you deduct gas taxes and wear and tear there isn't much left. Average gross is equivalent to $1 per mile. So if you provide 5 rides for a total of 40 miles expect to earn $40 - but the reality is you drove double that amount or 80 miles. The hot spots - don't bother. I drove to several way out of my area. Either the hot spots revert..., Sliding scale for commissions. 30% is ridiculous. UBER is going to isolate and lose its best (brand) drivers. Those remainiing are the unemployed who are desperate to work even at 0.50 a mile.
﻿Driver, Constantly able to get jobs and drive. The number of passengers in the city is nearly unlimited. The jobs are very frequent., The bad part would be that the rates are very low. For instance a drive from the city to the airport regardless of traffic is only twenty dollars or so, Make rates less competitive especially since there are many competitors within the business and outside. Take care of those who violate rules.
﻿Culture is great and you'll work hard!, The culture at Uber is everything! It's really easy to get pulled into your work. And what makes that a pro is that everyone at Uber is doing the same thing its both an encouraging and inspiring place to work at. The company never stands still and we're ALWAYS innovating off one another and our own ideas., Sometimes work-life-balance can suffer when you're being asked to work on lots of different tasks and being pulled in lots of different directions., As the company grows don't forget about the work-life-balance culture and the people who were there with you from the beginning!
﻿Circling The Drain, Meet people from all walks of time flexibility some feeling of independence., rates have been lowered again. this is the third rate cut since the late summer/early fall of 2014. no longer worth it to drive. you get entitled people with attitudes now. the rates are similar to poverty level after depreciation gas driving oil changes maintenance., you will be humbled later.
﻿Uber driving, Work when you want. Fun and easy work., Uber is making billions in at your expense. I made a "little" extra money in about 2 months but then they cut the rates raises their commissions AND recruited/allowed a large wave of new drivers on the road rendering ride requests nearly non existent for long periods even during "peak" hours. I could sell my son's Orgami art on the plaza or panhandle and make way more than driving around (or sitting in one place) waiting..., Change your business model to provide a better quality service at an appropriate cost to riders covering the retention of GOOD drivers who can make a realistic full time living. I would absolutely do it if it actually paid enough to even just cover the bills. And my requirements are not much. I have been highly complemented on my personality and the quality of my vehicle by many riders who claim that so many drivers...
﻿The truth about uber, Uber is taking too much from there Driver and we need to eat as well and we also using our vehicles and putting mileage on the vehicles and we need the money to take care of our vehicles... and our family as well so I believe they need to pay their drivers even more., Up the pay and we will love to communicate with a live person not emails, 
﻿Good for In-Between Jobs, Make your own hours work as little or as much as you want make your own rules and standards go on vacation or be sick whenever you please, Hard to do and maintain if you aren't self motivated no taxes or 401k or anything so have to pay taxes out of pocket every year, 
﻿Would recommend, - Some of the smartest most driven people I've met - be part of a quickly evolving industry - One of the most relevant companies for young people, - Hours - Pay is decent, Don't be stingy with benefits. Offer some education credits.
﻿This is the career lottery!, Free lunch/dinner catered daily. Prime location. Amazing work atmosphere. Great benefits!, Traffic when you have shifts scheduled in the week., Transparency is key to the success of an organization especially with the stakeholders.
﻿Paid well but that's about it, Paid very well for a work when you want contract position. Got to travel to some cool places to promote Uber., Tough working conditions one time we had to work in a legitimate storm and we did not get any bonus or anything. My general vibe is that anyone above you does not care whatsoever for your well being/understanding of why you're doing what you're doing. They just made me feel dumb., Work on creating some interaction vertically. I understand most people are contracted but at least create a sense of camaraderie so it doesn't leave a bad taste in peoples' mouths afterwards.
﻿Flexible but not very profitable., The ability to make your own schedule is pretty much the only positive with this position., UBER lowers the rates (your pay) whenever they want. You deal with drunk people at night. There isn't a phone number to call-only email. And every response via email is a canned response., Treat your drivers with more respect and add a tipping option!
﻿Uber, Smart people progressive always something new., Always something new. Early hours., 
﻿It's all about the people!, The people - Uber is the best company to work for in terms of its people. Every one is smart driven and really friendly and it means the culture here is second to none! The work - its varied it's challenging no day is ever the same., I haven't come across any yet! Though the hours can be long this was communicated to us during the interview process and the culture is so great it really doesn't matter, Keep it up. Ensure that we're continuing to hire people that fit Uber's culture.
﻿Life in the fast lane, * The vision is more meaningful than most Bay Area tech giants. * Everyone is super-pumped and the energy is inspiring addictive and contagious. * Truly data driven company. Everyone knows how to write queries and pull data., * Lot of very young and relatively inexperienced folks at senior levels; but that might even be a good thing! * The work hours are intense but one can find a suitable rhythm. Also if you aren't having fun then something is amiss., 
﻿Quick on time driver, Good and nice to customers, Sometimes vehicles arnt attractive, Hire people that are mature and serious
﻿DRIVER, Flexible schedule - You work any time you want to. No liability to pay anything if you don't work. Meet cool people from around the world. Good part-time opportunity., I would feel sorry for you if you have started work in the last few months. If you would calculate all your expenses you would be making less than minimum wage- YES LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. Uber is just focused on making money by squeezing drivers as much as it can. It was great when it started but once its position become solid in Seattle it took a U-Turn and just focused on making profits. Uber tries to fool..., Put some brakes on your greediness and think drivers as humans as well. How would you feel if you have to work twice as harder as you do and you would be offered half pay. When you need driver support you were sending so many offers to them but what happened now? Have you ever offered any promotion in the last year and half (just excluding the driver referrals). You are making money from the drivers so please treat...
﻿Poor review system: tired drunk upset riders rate you and get you fired!, I honestly liked working for UberX - flexible hours - opportunity to work outside of regular job - meet cool people, Whilst driving with UberX I was told to attend a driver improvement course I was told after the course that a customer gave me a 1 star and said this could have been because of the time of day that you picked the customer up (5am) customers at the time in the morning can be drunk or upset from working all night and are looking for somebody to take it out on. As a driver you are expected to have a rating above 4.3..., Provide proper training to drivers and be up-front about your review system. Provide information on expectations as a driver. Driver Training courses should be provided Rather then blaming them afterwards if they don't know the expectations that Uber doesn't tell new drivers. Please consider reactivating my account.
﻿Flexible hours meet interesting people decent pay, App problems several times Uber takes a higher percentage in SF for first 20 rides really makes you not want to drive on the weekend if you haven't driven during the week already., 25% cut is just too high to encourage drivers to stay on the road. I was happy with 20% but have decreased hours significantly because of the extra 5%., 
﻿Uber Partner, flexibility of schedule for drivers (labor), pay scale expenses no say in compensation levels, brilliant business model drivers (labor) considered an inexhaustible resource driverless cars still a decade or 2 off keep that in mind. word of mouth made Uber it (labor) can also be it's undoing.
﻿Great way to make money on the side, Opportunity to make good money Meet a lot of new people Convenient if you drive a lot already, Lots or wear and tear on car Not much help from the company as far as car maintenance. If you dont know your city busy times money will be scarce or wont be worth driving., Uber would do well to treat its drivers better because as it stands they treat them fairly poorly
﻿Uber Partner, Access to advanced technology autonomy to work and excel individually unlimited potential great opportunity to interact with customers., At this moment the only negative aspect might be the absolute reliance upon technology that prohibits having a human interface and human experience to expedite an urgent issue., 
﻿Ride share driver, No control over the fees Uber takes out of a ride. Uber can decide at any time to reduce the rate per ride resulting in reduced revenue for the driver., Be more active in requesting feedback from drivers to improve their experience. Create more opportunities to have drivers connect with the company., 
﻿DRIVER, Flexibility Low wages Low wages LOOOOOOOOWWWWW Wages, Low wage Cheap Passengers NO TIPS No Money., Increase the wages in Orlando or soon there will be no more drivers here. Competition is around the corner and then it could be too late for Uber.
﻿Uber Support Rep, some employee benefits include snacks + relatively laid back work environment., higher ups that are unwilling to listen to constructive criticism - lack of care for employees working with drivers every day., listen to your support team - we're the only ones standing between uber corporate and our fleet our partners.
﻿It's not sustainable for drivers., Great flexibility to make your own schedule. Fast money even faster if you sign up with another .com to get paid daily for a charge of $2/deposit (typically per day)., "Entitled customers" who don't care that you're driving 15 minutes to pick them up only to be driver a few of blocks from their pick-up location (you actually lose money in this situation since you only make the $3 minimum ride pay and used a gallon of gas (typically) and have to also account for wear & tear on your car). Passengers don't pay attention to the pick-up address that they entered only to find out that..., Spend some time in R&D to work out problems with the driver app. Some problems have been reported on the net (and supposedly to Uber Support) over a year ago and the fixes still haven't been rolled-out in the latest release of the driver app. Compensate the drivers so that they're taken care of if we drive far distances only to take customers a few blocks from their pick-up location.

﻿My favorite company to work for, - innovative disruptive - start up feel - HUGE impact - awesome smart people to work with - small team sizes - your ideas can be heard - Uber actually needs you!, - challenges around being a "start- upy" kind of company - some processes are still being created- moves fast, 
﻿Sr. Software Engineer, o Fast growth o A lot of interesting work o Good culture, Because of fast growth it can be little chaotic sometimes, 
﻿Brand Ambassador, Definitely not a full time or part time position unless you live in a really big city where you can market all the time to new people., Try to do more events in certain cities. I live in a city that has a lot going on but rarely is there any sort of booth set up with BAs talking about Uber and giving out promo codes!, 
﻿Hard Work. Hustle. Reward. Thrill, flat structure. extremely smart co-workers and team., work-life balance. not for people who value relationships, 
﻿Intern, Awesome company mission greta people who alll want to do great things with uber amazing company working dynamic good benefits and food, Work life balance stressful hours company culture can be a little taxing at times hard to go up the ladder burnout, 
﻿Pay could definitely be better, Per mile rate too low peak hours are not consistent referral system could be better support not may give you the wrong answer at times rewards program could use some improvement., I would love to work in different cities but I have been waiting for you guys to add a hotel discounts rewards., 
﻿Uber Driver, Flexible Schedules honestly the only upside, Too many to list its a seriously thankless job., be more like Lyft
﻿Flexible enough to work for anyone, Flexible be your own boss type of job that fuels you to achieve Siccess, Driving at peak hours require your tolerance for drunk people, Everything is great and is growing to stay that way
﻿driver, , , 
﻿Awesome software company, Forget about the usual red tape endless meetings and boring reports that you will do in other companies. At Uber everyone's focus is on getting stuff done and getting it done in the best way possible. At Uber you will have: - Brilliant colleagues top people from top places - Nothing to prevent you from doing the best that you can - A job that never becomes routine, The place is a rocket ship still taking off. You will either love keeping up with the speed or be vaporized in the process. I find work/life balance to be better than claimed by others but with Uber you will not have a 9-5 cookie cutter job., Keep going. For other brilliant companies the 'the sky is the limit' cliche might be fitting but I am sure that we will some day see UberSpace so it will take a while before we know what Uber's limit is.
﻿Fun Job, Work own schedule. Meet new and interesting people., Long odd hours. Not enough full time sustainable income., The 28% cut that Uber takes from fares makes the payout impossible to pay the bills.
﻿Great people interesting challenges, Incredibly intelligent people are everywhere at this company - and they need to be in order to solve the myriad problems that pop up on a daily basis. Working with the Uber partner-drivers is a truly special experience that brings home the impact that Uber makes in people's lives on a daily basis. The atmosphere in the office is very lively with an attitude that everyone will roll up their sleeves to get the job done., Work life balance is not very balanced. You don't notice it very much because the atmosphere and work are so enjoyable but when you work for Uber you work., Keep pushing forward with the strategic vision - it's what makes this company great.
﻿Is it Valid, Money and independence and work conditions, Long travel distances for those living in smaller towns, More opportunities and better distribution of jobs
﻿awesome perks and culture, - opportunity to get involved in as many projects as you'd like - you can learn anything! - employees are champions of Uber's core competencies and values - amazing and electrifying culture - employee perks! free catered lunch unlimited snacks and monthly Uber credit!, long hours can make work-life balance difficult,

﻿Not sustainable, Flexible work hours and flexible drive areas., Easy entry easy exit minimum wage job., Drivers' business plans are not sustainable. Management in its race to domination is also running a race to the bottom in lowering rates to drivers and raising fixed fees. Management needs to address the true costs of drivers' vehicle operational and insurance expenses.
﻿Uber Driver, , , 
﻿Uber is A bad company, Flexible hours not too much pressure from company resource app gets updated frequently., Very bad customer and driver support you would have to take a day out to travel all the way to their offices. Pay isnt that great since they take over 1/5 of what you make: which can range from $4.50(before their take) to $30 (IF YOURE LUCKY) They dont not care if you get into an accident in your car and will try every way to avoid compensating., Make your drivers feel a little more important before you go automated.

﻿Anonymous, Great pay and work environment for employees and customers, management is unstable and can be very unorganized, get organized
﻿Uber Driver, Signing in whenever you want and going home whenever you want. That's about it., You trade the value of your vehicle for cash... you don't really make any money. As an example I drove one evening and made about 12 trips over 4-5 hours and put almost 100 miles on my car. The trip total for my efforts was about $70 but my share (after Uber took their part) was $55 before taxes fuel expenses etc. So at 100 miles my gross pay was about .55 cents per mile. When you consider the IRS allows..., Add an optional tipping feature to the app so drivers can actually earn a little of money instead of trading their cars value for cash.
﻿People are awesome, Really great minds to work with. Very helpful people around. A lot of interesting work. A lot of opportunity to explore in technologies that you like. Engineers have the say! yay!, You will be really busy., improve the communication.
﻿Intern, a lot of passionate people and a promising mission, long working hours feel exhausted, 
﻿My experience has been pretty good, Extremely flexible you get out what you put into it you are your own boss offers some discounts at certain body shops. It is a great job for meeting new people and learning your way around the city., Vehicle depreciation sometimes it takes a while to get feedback from the support team because they only converse through email. Lately I've been feeling the business has slowed down and I think it's because it's a lot of other uber drivers out there I would recommend doing uber and lyft., I wish they would allow the riders to tip through the app.
﻿Driver, Lots of work always at most hours of the work day., They do not TRACK ANY OF YOUR EXPENSES, Give the drivers an application to track their gas and other car expenses.
﻿Partner Support Representative, Great team of Partner Support Representatives., Unable to fix many problems that come from engineering side., 
﻿BEST BUSINESS IN THE WORLD, Work on your own schedule Make Make Make money by driving driving and earning just drive #uberon, everything is just great with Uber nothing to complain. Drive today #Uberon!, Keep up the great work Uber is the best for ever!
﻿Uber, The ability to work as much or as little as the driver deems necessary., No type of training or instructions. Everything you learn you acquire on your own. No way to move upward in the company., 
﻿Terrible, Flexibility in work hours. Saturday nights are the best time to work., Terrible pay. They are over 100% cheaper than taxi's. Flawed rating system. Uber doesn't let the customers know that they need to have car seats while transporting children or that you can't bring open containers of alcohol in the vehicle which always results in a very bad ratings for the drivers even when your polite to the customer. They advertise you can make $1500/week. I have averaged worked well over 50 hours a..., Read above.
﻿Software Engineer, Fast growth Engaged Employees Opportunities to work on a variety of projects Bold leadership, The open office style is pretty annoying to me. Downsides depend on your title/office but there aren't any major ones., Focus on mentorship. Make the vision super clear. Make it clear what each team is doing for that vision. Keep up the bold bets.

﻿Partners, You choose your time and just need drive. piece cake, You will destroy the car for almost nothing. It's around 10/H - gas - car. In one year your car will have a lot of miles and drop the value, Pull up the price
﻿Uber subject the people to fraud & abuse, Work when you want -- if you are desperate and will work for almost nothing. You have to pretend that the cost of your car doesn't exist to believe that you actually make any money., Uber is a master of fraud and deception. Claims you make 'x' amount but doesn't account for their fees your gas tires brakes oil changes cleaning which will add up to more than you expect or effectively track; and of course the cost of the car is something that people don't properly account for. Net income with Uber will be between $3.75 & $8.50 per hour if you accurately calculate the expenses over the long term...., 
﻿Summer intern, , , 
﻿I love my job!, The creativity flexibility and overall culture makes Uber an amazing company to work for. They are constantly coming out with innovative ways to take people for point A to point B and they focus on everyone hustling and owning the business. It's definitely not a clock in and clock out type of environment because everyone takes 100% ownership in what they do and expect to work until it gets done., There can definitely be long hours and weekends where you need to work but it's gratifying and exciting work., 
﻿Once in a lifetime opportunity, Incredible empowerment of every employee. Super exciting pace of work. Awesome benefits and atmosphere, You never really switch off from the work but we don't really mind., 
﻿Great source of income, Flexible technology oriented and very responsive., Their structure lacks a call center., Stay ahead of the curve.
﻿I haven't started driving yet. I was just approved last night actually., So far the driver support team has been prompt and helpful. No bosses. Work when you want to. Not sure of the pay just yet but it is weekly so that's convenient., I don't know since i was just approved last night and haven't done any trips yet. Not being sure about the pay is a concern though., Keep on keepin' on.
﻿Great Opportunity, Work when you want just open the app and start driving. Paid as a 1099 contractor so get to write off miles etc. Riders are nice, Wear on vehicle. At full time I'll put 200 miles on in a night, Pay drivers the cancellation fee when a client cancels
﻿Driver, Schedule flexibility takes 3 days to get signed up, Most money made when dealing with drunk customers pay is very low and not worth damage on car unless working late night/early morning, Don't allow your "partners" to pick up 4 people and drop them off 30 blocks away for a grand total of $2.32. (Just a thought)
﻿The most exciting company in the world, As other people have said everyone you work with here is at the top of their game -- succeeding here is to succeed anywhere. You can build autonomously -- there is not a ton of bureaucracy you have the ability to directly impact users and work on visible features. Very fast paced development -- a couple of weeks from idea to rollout is usual.

﻿Uber in Las Vegas, First of all you have Flexible hours. You also have the excitement of being an entrepreneur by being your own boss., You have to put wear and tear on your own vehicle.

﻿Amazing Opportunity, Constantly faced with meaty problems and huge responsibility. While it can be daunting it's an unbelievable learning environment and all of my coworkers are excited to take on challenges., The hours can be long but I tend to enjoy them because I'm really passionate about the work I'm doing as are the people around me., Keep looking for ways to align teams and ensure that efforts aren't being needlessly duplicated.

So if you get sick you will be broke with no insurance, Give a little more to the employees that are making this business successful and bringing in money to pay your salary

﻿Brand Amb and UberX driver, fast changing young kids pretty clueless about running a company. Meaning you can climb quickly., incompetent logistics managers. clueless., hire some color. White College Graduates does not equate or replace experience Get some color at the office.
﻿Bottom line: not worth you time or hustle., Flexible schedule All what you need to do it is a clean record (driving criminal) and that's it. They will even lease you a car with no credit check., I'm basing this review after driving for them for more than 6 months. If you are interested please do yourself a favor and read till the end. I'm sharing this with you because I didn't know these facts till later. I felt so bad and I don't want anybody to be in the same situation I'm at. Cons A lot of cons. You have the objective cons that are purely related to the driving field itself. And then you have Uber cons...., Start caring about your drivers. You know that you're losing so many. That's why you're paying $500 as a referral reward.

﻿Tough working in CT, Set your own schedule easily., Not much business during normal hours., Increase fares. People are less price sensitive than you think. People take Uber for safety and reliability. Not tot save 5% vs a taxi.
﻿Uber Driver, The best thing about driving for Uber is the ability to create your own schedule; unfortunately that's the only thing that's good., Uber sets the ride fare and sets it very low in an attempt to drive the competition out of business. The streets are saturated with Uber drivers all volleying for the next passenger. If it weren't for their continuous and deceptive recruiting efforts they would probably be out of business or they would have to raise the fares to something reasonable to get drivers. After deducting all of your expenses as well as the..., Get the prices to something reasonable. Drivers are expected to provide uber service at a super-discount price you cant do both over a long period of time.
﻿Rocket Ship, - Super talented people are flocking to Uber from the Bay Area's top tech companies - Things move so much faster here than anywhere else I've worked - you'll be able to get much more done - Legitimately changing the world, - Long hours (but if they feel like work you're doing something wrong), - Keep up the focus on making a great product ignore the haters.
﻿I've never loved a job or a company this much, Exciting energy whip-smart colleagues insanely big impact world-changing mission (not lip service) supportive culture to achieve your best., You have to keep your own passion in check. You can work yourself to the bone if you're not careful. But that's entirely up to you., Cultural values are quite numerous and have triggered lots of feedback so please keep listening.
﻿Partner Driver, Freeing travel meet people just basically hang out for 10-20 mins even up to an hr or so depending on the destination with some chill SF commuters., In SF it can be near impossible to just find yourself a place to park to take a 15-30 min break. Finding a restroom is a nightmare I say just figure that out beforehand it took me a few days to realize I was just doing it all backwards. It has nothing to do with the work or company itself I just figured most people probably dont consider these things when they go online to drive for the first time., Im so waiting for the daily commuter rides to expand out of South Bay to the East Bay. Soon as I am notified Im in there!
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule so it's great for students and anyone who wants to work part time for a bit of extra money on the side., There isn't much help to drivers with any issues you face on the road. Sometimes the pay is bad just because of demand but that isn't so much on Uber it's more on the demand of your city., 
﻿Not all its cracked up to be, 1. ability to set your own schedule, 1. not enough demand during the day 2. no call center 3. forget it as a full time job if you're not willing to put up with the bar crowd 4. Uber makes it sound like the drivers will be rich 5. no fare adjustment based on the price of gas 6. terrible customer service considering that Uber takes a minimum of 20% from each fare, 
﻿Awesome Place (if you can get in!), -Work with the smartest people! -Fun place to be! Everyone is engaged and working their tail off. It's almost like being in college again. -Young environment. -Happy hours tons of great perks pre-IPO, -You work your butt off!, Stay private as long as possible!
﻿Potentially works out but frustrating at times, extreme flexibility. Definitely a plus in terms of social networking especially during weekend nights. Not bad especially as an additional income source., Could be frustrating especially for beginners but could be avoided from studying trends beforehand., It might be helpful to have new comers to meet up with experinced drivers to ease up process. Even though there is an online community for uber drivers but there needs to be one on one get togethers to facilitate mutualism and understanding.

That combined with the standard of transparency we have here makes this an awesomely..., There's a lot of work to be done before we can reach a stable place. Even as we grow it feels like a start-up with long hours and a free flexible management system. To me (and other good fits) these are actually pros not cons. You have the freedom to solve big problems the way you think is best. Everyone here works a lot so if you have a vibrant life outside of the office you'll probably struggle. Even after a 13-hour..., Stay cool. Don't get too lofty.
﻿Marketing Manager, Casual workplace paid healthcare Uber credit and other perks. Most importantly it's a great product., Terrible managers and bad office politics. Managers receive little to no training and it shows in their inability to handle leading teams. It's somewhat reminiscent of middle school - lots of backbiting and gossip bordering on sabotage. Very unprofessional environment bordering on toxic., Culture starts at the top so show humility and the importance of teamwork over personal gloating and cockiness.
﻿Great Service - TERRIBLE JOB, It is great to work when you want Uber has an excellent platform for riders. Nice not to be micro managed, Greedy Mega Corp could care less about Drivers. Charges 25%. It use to be 15% - 20% Just open passenger app and see how many drivers out there working and not making a penny. Problems paying employees and if you have a problem you have to deal with tech service in India. When you factor in cost of operating a vehicle is $0.575 per mile(IRS) and all the time waiting for a passenger you will not make minimum wage. And..., Lower fee charged to drivers who are doing all the driving and waiting around.
﻿College student friendly, Uber is a great company for college students looking to supplement their income.

If you are disabled in your feet and cannot walk to perform work this is a solution. If you can figure out how not to be scammed you might earn some money. It takes a great deal of will., Uber conceals everything. There are very serious lawsuits against it as an entity. The UBER GIS application is defective deficient and fails to inform the Driver of the actual south or north or east or west location of the RIDER. The Driver has to pay for all the mileage she or he incurs during their work has to pay high fees for insurance at .39 a mile when driving to pick up or return from having just left a..., Get legal.

There are great perks at headquarters and the company really cares about the well-being of employees., There are definitely long hours but management is aware of how hard the team is working. However it is definitely a high-pressure environment., Management is almost too data driven - unless you can definitively prove something with numbers you won't be listened to. Which is better than the alternative but can create a lot of extra work.
﻿Uber Low, Its a great job to get away with. Traveling to places you don't know because you don't know how far you are going until you pick your riders up. Unless the rider is kind enough to input ahead of time. Only great if you live or drive out to a busy areah. You also get cool discounts at some car places. Their support team replies fast and very friendly compared to poor lyft., You pay your own gas and maintenance. If you dont have some money in your pocket and a full tank dont expect to make it far or any profit. You need to invest a little to get a good jump off. If you drive far or get in an accident they most likely wont take care of you so avoid that., Give drivers free rooms or discounts on them. So they are not exposed to drive far and become exhausted with the long drives. And look out for them when accidents happen.

These trips can take 30 minutes since we have to drive to the rider wait (sometimes 15 minutes) then drop them off. After gas we'll only make a dollar or so in 30 minutes. On the flip side you can...
﻿Great place to work hard to get a better position, It's a very dynamic-working place with a lot of cool people and a great environment, Salaries and perks need to change a bit (LATAM region) You don't have a career path, Find ways to motivate and to promote excellent working on the front desk agents (PSR) so they can always have a smile while doing their job because they don't need to worry about paying bills
﻿Uber "Partner", Expenses can add up to more than you make. $500 set of tires $1000 timing belt $200 brakes oil changes & fuel etc., Charging less then half of a cab/taxi barely gives your partners much left after expenses., 
﻿Driver, Work when ever I want to work., Waiting on the app for customers, Keep up the good work. If anything goes wrong you can contact support easy.

﻿Good company but only if you're permanent/full-time, Delicious lunches provided for free and an excellent snack selection. The main office has a beautiful layout and design., Long hours 0 flexibility for contract workers no breaks given aside from an (occasionally) 20-minute lunch inconsistent and incomplete training managers were difficult to work with emphasis on high quantity over high quality service., Give employees the breaks due to them according to New York labor laws and ensure that the training given via shadowing is consistent.
﻿driver, meet with different people from every where around the wold., working as a driver is not my dream job, 
﻿Imagery Operator, The environment: everyone in the office talks to one another and every month or so a launch party is held with food and beverages., Most people who work here are contract and the pay is not the best., Hire fewer people pay them more.
﻿Brand Amabassador, Great Job! Great Bonus! Great Supervisors! Great Benefits!, Pay is not great for all the hard work! No room for growth! We shouldn't loss our bonuses if recruit driver doesn't start driving. We can lead a horse to water but we can't make them drink!, Would love to use my management skills in a better way with better pay with Uber! I love the company and have great ideals.
﻿Driver, Is pretty decent for the time and money you spend driving. you really make more depending on how much you work., Passengers can be unforgiving sometimes. The rating system is really bad if you get a 4.6 out of 5 you risk account termination., Please adjust the rating system.
﻿Very unprofessional company that has incompetent mangers., There are a few pros at the PHX COE. You can come to work dressed as a bumb and many do! You get free lunch and dinner as well as snacks., Admittedly cutthroat environment management will terminate an employee with more knowledge than them. They encourage thinking outside the box and asking tough questions problem is you run the risk of being terminated., Travis needs to get managers and trainers that are professional and embrace the assets new employees bring. Uber has a potential to be a awesome company but there are several issues in Phx anyway. A straight white male is an endangered species at Phx COE. There is an environment of hypersensitivity without a doubt to the point good people are shown the door.
﻿Customer support, The people are wonderful and the atmosphere is positive. Flexible work schedule, No downside yet. Uber has been a great company to work with., Communication is key to success.
﻿Uber will change the world, Great place to work, Nothing at all that is important, Keep going
﻿Corporate Paralegal, Fast growing company which makes it the right place if you like to grow! Amazing overall atmosphere - good work vibe. Great benefits., Cant really find any cons working for this job. My overall experience have been more then great., Be aware to keep up with the growth - hire people when needed.
﻿Driver, Solid Company Awesome Support With a lot of patience via Phone Center. Very Easy Going, Lengthy Background Check and Very Picky regards to the year of Our Vehicles if you're new., Lower Lease Option Payments & Speed Up Process with Local Dealerships in San Diego County for us partners.
﻿Bike Courier, Work when ever you want, Not enough work sometimes. filler, 
﻿Driver, You'll stay busy. Setting your own hours., Fraudulent hiring scams. They don't pay bonuses promised. Who wants to work for a company that rips off their best employees?, I have contacted a dozen people through Uber support that all agreed I completed the 25 trips in 30 days and should received my bonus within two weeks. Now five weeks later Uber of Denver is denying payment so I quit. How does this help your business suceed? I was a very high-rated driver.
﻿Part time driver, Make decent money at busy and surging times. Make good money on weekends. Great money on holidays., Only good for the weekend. You can't make good money during a normal weekday. After ubers 20% and rider fee not making as much as you think., Increase the per minute pay rate. When you're stuck in traffic you're not making much.
﻿Best Co-workers Ever, The smartest kindest people you'll ever work with Risk taking is encouraged Hard work is rewarded with compensation / bonus Huge opportunities to grow, long hours/weekends demanding work schedule, Keep hiring rock stars. Invest in employees looking to grow.
﻿Uber, , , 
﻿Would suggest this job for full time employment, Work when you want...good for appearance of long term employmenmt, cheap fares barely cover business costs, put a tip section on the app
﻿Awesome ship for awesome engineers, Uber is growing really really really fast. Seriously you'll see the hockey stick growth everywhere number of riders/drivers number of new employees number of money we make etc. This is also a really fun and cool place for Software Engineers. Compare to big companies Uber is still very small. Each team is extremely small. There are so many problems we want to solve. My peers are extremely talented no matter..., Lunch cartering could be better, Keep the unique culture. Keep the hiring bar high.
﻿Great People Poor Pay, Set your own hours meet all kinds of interesting people flexible. I really like the people I've been helping out., The system is made for Uber and passengers. The drivers are the bottom of the totem pole. The pay is very poor. After Ubering for a few weeks now pay is around $10-$15 per hour and that doesn't include gas expenses. Uber told me to drive to Lincoln because business would boom. I drove an hour to lincoln only to make $12 an hour. Uber GPS doesn't always work and you'll go to locations that don't exist. You..., Invest in people that invest in the quality of the company.
﻿Driver, Driving for Uber is very flexible. You can drive as little as you want or stop driving for weeks on a whim., The downside will depend on where you are driving in Boise right now waiting to drive someone could be up to 3 hours. It really depends on your location and how many riders are requesting rides., They should stop accepting new drivers if I have to wait over 3 hours for some rides. Also when I get rides back to back I still only make like $8 an hour after paying for gas in my honda civic the amount drivers get should be increased.
﻿Uber Sydney, Ever-changing work - processes constantly change so you are exposed to a lot of different things fun office environment with good team and regular events free lunch every day of the week!, Minimal training - as a rapidly scaling company the processes behind training are very chop and change and sometimes non-existent. There sometimes seems to be a very big divide between upper management decisions and the less senior employees., 
﻿Extremely smart and hardworking people, Good benefits equity free Uber credit to use every month., Forget your family and friends. Hanging out with your coworkers working at 10pm in the office will be closest to a social life that you will have.,

﻿Feels great to be a part of the next big thing in tech, In tech we have seen a few major waves: Productivity desktop software the Internet search e-commerce smart phones social and each of these things had a front-runner company that left its mark on tech. The next big thing is the on-demand app economy and Uber is the front-runner for that. It feels great to ride this wave -- both in terms personal finances and the impact we're able to make. The overall company objectives..., It's in SF so commutes can suck... but that's about it., Bring the perks on par with Google Facebook Dropbox AirBnB and the rest. Catered breakfast and 6pm dinners. It keeps us more productive and sends a signal that you care about us... that you won't replace us with self-programming-programmers down the line cuz u care :-) ... you would but just sayin'.
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule and that's all folks!!, Horrible hourly pay even before taxes and expenses tipping would help offset this but uber markets against this aspect... reason why ceo is ranked 290th wealthiest.. goes to show you dont be a driver make algorithms and pay your employees poorly., Restructure fares or encourage tipping you cheap fuvks.
﻿Drivers are getting shafted!, Work whenever you want to., Rates keep dropping which means driver pay drops. Uber doesn't pay for gas or maintenance so if rates continue to drop I will have to look to other avenues if employment., The average rider has no idea that tipping is not required. I'm constantly questioned as to how to add a tip on the app. Please add tip option to app. Uber discounts are insulting. Give me something that can really help me with gas and maintenance.
﻿Great experience if you fit the culture, if you are not into that culture you shouldn't work here because the culture will eat you and spit you out., keep going! loved everything make sure that the food gets better!, 
﻿Not terrible not great, Flexible hours are nice. Money isn't too bad if you are using it as a supporting platform but doesn't work too well as a sole income., There are quite a few but the biggest complaint I have is the rating standards. The company feels anything less than 5 stars is inadequate (and reason to break the contract)., Go out and drive for a couple of weeks. That's really all I can suggest because I've a feeling there's a disconnect between management's perception of the world against the way it actually is.
﻿Good company, Work whenever you want, Constant rate cuts no benefits, No
﻿Driver net income is only $10-$15 per hr. Uber is very cheap to pay driver., flexible time easy to work, Uber payment to the driver is very poor., Must reduce Uber fee from 25% to 17%. Get rid off rider fee from driver. Be fair with driver.
﻿Uber is a great part time job, It is fun. I meet a lot of strange people and the job was relatively easy to get., It can be tough on your car but honestly not terrible., 
﻿Uber Partner, It is very very flexible, the fares are low and getting lower, 
﻿Uber Driver / Partner, Get to choose your own hours and support is everywhere IF you need it. Meet great people while making a few bucks!, Maintenance and fuel costs. I drive a nice Yukon Denali and should have the choice to just to pick up XL Riders. Driving the bigger vehicle at 13 miles to a gallon does not make it cost effective to drive Uber X Rides., Provide option to accept XL Only for XL Drivers. People like Uber better than cabs and I think it would be safe to raise the rates to be comparable.
﻿Uber Is Big but Still Thinks and Acts Small., Responsibility Autonomy Creativity are all not only promoted but required to succeed here., Hours can be long (this shouldn't be a surprise), 
﻿Horrible Experience - Hopefully a One Off Situation, This company is evolving the private transportation sector in a rapid manner. The Uber credits and stock options are excellent perks for full-timers. It is easy to wake up in the morning and feel energized about your work. People love the services you provide., During my 1 month at Uber Cincinnati I : - Saw my direct supervisor for less than 6 hours - Was as a Trainee the ONLY Uber emloyee in Ohio (including my team) who is not based in Columbus. During weekly Ohio syncs all 30 other employees were in the Columbus conference room and I would be on a computer in Cincinnati unable to hear 60% of the meeting and feeling very awkward and left out. - Never felt like part..., Be more careful in your hiring process in order to balance teams. I found that of our city team of 7 people 5 of them were severely analytical types. Cohesiveness is lacking especially for nUbers. The Central Region spoke about this and I experienced it (as I stated a very isolated manner). I felt that your team's youth is a pro and a con especially with regards to my City manager. Try to hire managers with...
﻿Operations coordinator, Independent Fast paced Young and smart team Self management Data driven Engaging, Limited opportunity for growth - large jump to management level, Personal development
﻿Do not drive for them, Flexible schedule but you end up driving at horrible times to make decent money. It can be fun. I need 20 words minimum but I can't think of anything else., After expenses you make less than minimum wage. Your car will be ruined. Passengers can be horrible and do things like throw up in your car., Raise rates. You aren't going to make Lyft go away with lower rates. You are only ruining the quality of your company.
﻿Good Company, This is a fast-paced company. I love their attention to detail and care of their employees. The hours are flexible and good for a part-timer. Being a driver is bogus. I am making less than a year ago. Friendly customers mostly and great pay, I am new and sometimes feel it is not worth it at all. Their fares seem rather low compared to the amount of work involved. The last time I drove 30 minutes to pick somebody up that just wanted to go to a bar 5 mins away. Total cost was $5 and after Uber's deduction I was left with nothing. Considering the wear and tear on my car I am not sure if the total costs outweighs the benefits, Increase benefits protection and reimbursement. More friendly customer service. More training also. Uber needs to stand behind their drivers or at least investigate customer complaints carefully.
﻿Stressful, Nice perks like food free lunch. Good teamwork with opportunities to contribute., It's a stressful job and we needed more support from management to get through the day-to-day. It felt like we were understaffed and we need some more reps so we can eat lunch at an appropriate time., Hire more representatives.
﻿Driver, Hire yourself and work at your leisure., Money is nothing near what they say it will be., 
﻿driver, self employed able to work when want, wear on vehicle long hours to make good money, should have management to actually see some of the vehicles and should have a sticker or notation for other drivers to make comments regarding drivers habits
﻿Very cool and talented people every were, very employee friendly..has the freedom to explore different technologies and learn lot...good compensation package especially stocks you get, while food is free but its not great..menu getting boring after a while and you don't have choice to choose and no good snacking in break rooms, have our own cafe with different cuisines and fill more on snack bar
﻿The Uber Life(style) Experience, International teams with a great percentage of intelligent people., No appreciation. No life., Recognition and appreciation of hard work and sacrifices would make you more
﻿Uber Review, You can control your own schedule., Gas money and depreciation of car take away a lot from the amount you make., Keep finding ways to help drivers make more money by analyzing hot spots.
﻿Great up-and-coming company fun work environment smart, There is autonomy and ownership in one's role which is encouraged and enhanced by collaborating with the rest of the cities worldwide to enhance the company and grow with the company., So far I haven't experienced any Cons,

﻿Beware of Uber., No Pros Don't work for these people They don't care about they're employees., What do construction companies strip clubs and services like Uber and Lyft have in common? The answer is that they’ve all been sued for trying to skirt the law by treating their workers as contractors instead of employees—a long-standing issue that is being exacerbated by the rise of the so-called sharing economy., Don't work for this corporation. They don't care about the people they hire.
﻿Awesome company awesome culture, Best idea wins Significant equity Great culture lot of smart people. Awesome problems to work on if you're bored here God help you., You might end with more things that you can handle! You would need to plan your time well. That's it that's all I got!, You're awesome!

﻿Gettingworse, Flexibility meet different people work when your available. Can use own car, You have to work harder to make the amount I originally started out with. Uber makes more then 20 percent when you calculate safe ride fee, Stop cutting fares. Reimburse easier and stop charging partners the uber safe ride fee
﻿Former Community Manager on the East Coast, • Amazing smart fun coworkers • You can be creative in terms of how you go about your job • Meritocracy for the most part • Organized and efficient overall • You can work from anywhere... you have a home base office but if you're traveling you can work from that Uber office. They don't care what you do as long as you get your work done. • Hipchat makes it easy to stay in touch with colleagues all over the country, • Very stressful • Long hours • You work evenings weekends and holidays • Constant metrics-based evaluation means you're always thinking about the next thing • Hard to wait on stuff from the Design team which is at HQ so if you're in an office that's not there you feel like you're blind and dependent on them, Make sure people take time off (and that they don't have to do tickets while they're off). Let people do what they're good at -- move them around to where they're a better fit.
﻿Lack of assistance, Schedule flexibility independence stress free reasonable source of income., Drivers are just statistics. Issues can only be resolved via email. When emails are replied they're computer generated messages therefore totally unrelated to the issue. Emails are ignored for days until you receive a response not just questions but urgent matters too. Hours guarantees and bonuses are paid after several emails and they say it's an automated process., More effective driver care.
﻿Driver, Fast cash easy to use. Driving for Uber gives me the ability to work when I want where I want., Demand times can be challenging. When there is no demand for drivers it can be hard to be constructive as a driver., 
﻿Driver, You can meet a lot of nice people and you can make your own schedule other than that refer to the cons section., The pay is horrible!! You will be doing a lot of driving for a $5 fair that you end up only receiving $3.50 of. You will have to drive late at night to actually make any money. Their gps system will get you lost or take a while to load and the passengers will rate you poorly. The guaranteed paid ours are not guaranteed at all so read the very very very fine print before signing up. In the end it just wasn't worth it...., Pay your drivers better and make your guarantees really guaranteed!!
﻿Driver Operations, Great being a part of such a hip company. Awesome office free food (yes beer too) and you get a laptop. Cool being around such hard working and inspiring people. You can wear what you want - even flip flops good or bad as that may be., Not a very healthy work/life balance. Management and full-time employees need to treat contractors better and offer them more opportunities to be hired on., Please treat contractors better.
﻿Great Product | Bad Management, It's amazing to see the product you work on and market start becoming viral and actually changing lives and transportation patterns around you. Extremely smart people who are super motivated to make Uber the greatest company on Earth!, No work / life balance - 16 hour days are common Quality of managers is surprisingly bad over the past few months and as a result growth of team members has been severely impacted., Make hiring better especially among city managers. If a city manager cannot own a city that city and it's employees will languish.
﻿Outstanding Support and Culture, Some of the sharpest individuals I've met from diverse backgrounds (consulting i-banking start-ups growth departments of top tech companies) intense and focused culture with people who support hard work ethic and contribute beyond their roles., Intense culture and demanding roles are not for everyone don't come here for the cush job..., The transparency and trust from management is awesome so far (been 1 month) I've only been impressed with management's decisions and the ease at which you can approach them.
﻿Great Place to Be!, Great place to work and thrive - super transparent culture and plenty of sharp/bright/like-minded individuals. It's extremely refreshing to work with the caliber of people that we have at Uber.

I felt a lot of camaraderie. • Really exciting and dynamic place to work. The huge amount of growth leads to a lot of hard and exciting problems. Almost every week and weekend was record-breaking in some way. • Everyone worked hard to make sure I had a great..., • Somewhat disorganized especially for interns. I wasn't presented a project when I arrived because team was busy launching something. • So-so "intern program." This was the first summer that Uber had a formal internship program. They planned a few great events but some weren't so good. They also didn't have any events until I was almost halfway through my internship. • Poor work/life balance. People work their butts..., 
﻿Being a Part of Something So Big You Can Feel It., + You get to work side-by-side with some of the smartest minds in tech. + You move fast. Everyone moves fast. Boredom is non-existent. + You actually get to see your work produced. + Energy levels are high and positive all around. + The company has a great culture that that feels truly authentic., - Constant change can cause some distraction. - Unprecedented growth can seem daunting. - Communications across the company and across departments could use some work., Stay fierce. Listen closely.
﻿Driver, Work when you want pick people up, Uber make the customer think the drivers are the one charging the them. Because someone told Uber that I was charging to much. And Uher never took my side and said drivers don't have control over how much Uber charge. So if a customer rates low and say driver charged to much that's Uber's responsibility to tell the people Uber makes up the prices. Uber know that your car will get wear and tear and you have to..., You really need to make a lot of changes. I know you are a billionaire but sometimes they need to take advice from others
﻿Not worth it., - Free Uber credits - Free lunches - Potential to make bank via stock options (although I hear new employees are getting shafted on that front), - Due to all the bad press you'll start avoiding telling new acquaintances where you work at cocktail parties. - No work-life balance—there's definitely a 24/7 "workhorse" culture. They expect you to drink the Kool-Aid and give up your life. - Poor management. Higher-ups don't care about their employees and just dictate unrealistic directives. At least that's how it is in Ops. - Back-breaking workload. You will..., Invest in improving culture. Make employees feel empowered and supported. Don't serve dinner at 8pm to make folks feel like they should actually be in the office at that hour. Burnout is a very real thing.
﻿Sneaky, Uber is very tricky and manipulative. They exploit both passengers and drivers. They are far less transparent than other ride sharing companies., Don't force drivers to adopt an "uber" phone even if they opt out and then still charge them for it!, 
﻿Fast paced & Fun -- you gotta keep up., Great People & Culture Fast paced lots going on Growth opportunity Start up vibe, Not competitive salaries for tech industry Long hours, 
﻿Great First Impression, Great benefits/ perks Everyone is a rock-star in their own discipline Very positive productive culture located in the heart of SF Everyone is a rockstar in their disciplines -- very talented teams, Long hours but they aren't bad if you like the people and company, No advice needed they are doing a good job promoting a productive culture

Most of the passengers are pleasant thanks to the well-conceived idea that the rating system is a two-way street for drivers and passengers.

Working when you want to or when you're able..., A job is only ideal if it pays the bills. Otherwise it's really more of a hobby. Such is unfortunately the case here. I've been working fewer and fewer hours because after doing the math the compensation is horrific. Last week I made $8.33 / hour. That is until you deduct the money I spent on gas - I drive a fuel-efficient Japanese sedan and after gas expenses last week I made $5.55 / hour. That shouldn't even..., Raise your fares even a little. You can still under-cut the cab companies and charge more than you are currently. That or lower the 20% cut you take from our fares but I know that's not happening. I'm also sure that the current fares are the result of metrics and market research studies and future growth projections and therefore are also unlikely to change.
﻿Driving Partner, The pros are choosing your own schedule being your own boss and finding freedom in working for yourself. You work with Uber as a partner create your own income and are able to have the freedom that you want and the life you enjoy; by simply giving a few rides a night to mostly friendly people who need transportation., I've never seen any down sides to this business or this business model, Keep up the great work!
﻿All aspects Horrible Terrible and deceptive, Uber invented a way to destroy the lower class put more in poverty., Deceptive false reality fraudulent motives spying classicism practices prey on the less fortunate to build their business. If not for the lower class this business model would not have survived. The surge price lacks passengers willing to pay. I quit driving long ago delete the app and still get deceptive desperate emails full of lies., It's obvious your business is suffering I guess what goes around comes around. You should have shared the wealth with your worthy drivers and you would still have business long after the bubble burst. After expensives your drivers will never make minimum wage.
﻿Driver, Complete flexibility. (For the Worker!), Communication with management was poor when I started but has definitely improved., Keep improving the app. Keep working on the insurance issues.
﻿Everything is great except the review system!, Work your own hours as many or as few as you'd like as long as your participate once a month. Meet a lot of people and make a decent wage if you choose to work a ton of hours. Can get hired very quickly and almost anyone can be hired so long as you're not a criminal have a good car and good insurance. Uber Support was very active to respond to my questions quickly in my initial stages of hire., The rating system will get you fired before you can even start! You must keep an over 4.7 rating to stay driving. Riders rate you after you drive based on their experience. If you don't get all 5 star ratings every time Uber will fire you. Riders DONT KNOW THIS so it's way easy to get fired. Most people think a 4 star rating is a good rating and will give you that but a 4 star rating will get you FIRED...it's an extremely..., Read my cons - please make an adjustment!! Please!! Change your rating system to a simple binary thumbs up thumbs down system! It's binary anyway isn't it?! Anyone driving with a 45% or lower rating should be at risk for firing but 46% and higher should be completely SAFE. Why not 50/50? Because people tend to rate negative over positive and you should always give your drivers the benefit of the doubt IF you are...
﻿Recruiting Process, , , 
﻿Changing the World, Pros - Legitimately changing the world. In the last 3 months alone (i've been here 18) I've launched changes that allow any deaf person globally to have a new source of income. - Work doesn't feel like work (and if it does you're doing it wrong) - Amazing people. Seriously talented influential entrepreneurial yet casual people I love working with and consider my friends. - Right answer wins - Land of Opportunity...., None I can think of, - Keep the bar as high as it is and only hire more super talented people
﻿Operations Manager, Great people culture and work, Some growing pains as company aims to double in a few years. Mgmt needs to figure out the clearest way of promoting people, Figure out the layers and hierarchy needed for a place as large as this...
﻿Fantastic company with super strong growth potential, - Great culture values (innovative fierceness hustling superpumpedness teamwork...) - Strong senior leadership especially with a visionary and down-to-earth CEO - Data driven facts-based operational process - Very fast-paced strong bias towards action - Awesome people, - Multiple office buildings can cause some fragmentation, 
﻿Good steady work., Work at home Choose hours Take off whenever, No security Lack of communication No benefits, 
﻿Independent Driver, Free to be scheduled when you need to., Puts many miles on the car., 
﻿Uber Partner/Driver, Flexibility is great pay is decent for the work involved. Meet interesting people., App is below average and flaky. No tipping option for riders in app, Add tipping option for riders.
﻿It's what you make it, Flexibly is the top benefit., In order to get he best pay you need to work the worst shifts - aka weekend and the graveyard shift. Or holidays. If you own your car you end of putting a huge about of miles on it and depreciate re value quickly.... There are ways around this - uber's leasing program is pretty good. Over all you can earn some extra cash on your own schedule but you have to factor in your extra costs (car maintenance fuel cleaning..., Please increase the rates the drivers make so that we don't have to hustle to the point of being unsafe on the road.
﻿Operations Coordinator, Incredible company with an incredible team!, Huge hours + huge responsibility! Not for those without hustle!, Awesome process. Great recruiter with a really streamlined process.
﻿found my happy place, my engineering team has an excellent technical level. I'm learning a lot. We have great discussions. Lots to do too and many opportunities to do super high-impact work. At a macro level we are doing something important and valuable - taking cars off the roads creating hundreds of thousands of jobs enabling passengers with more transportation options., uber is one of the most scrutinized companies in the world. it's also a very convenient villain and misconceptions abound. Politicians get exposure by opposing uber and some find there is more to gain by doing so than by serving the interest of their constituents. This can be frustrating. My internal (and informed!) view of uber is very different from what i can read about it., Don't do dinner with people who will misquote you the next day. make the brand more approachable. uber is no longer an exclusive service for the rich. help cities achieve better planning through our data science.
﻿Fastest-Paced Engineering Company, Uber is doing the most incredible engineering. Everything has to change constantly to handle our growing scale and to do it the company has assembled the biggest cross section of talent in the Bay Area. No place has more opportunities to learn from so many engineers and contributed to so many projects., May have to work long hours sometimes and fight fires when oncall but the company has a high engineering bar for quality and testing that is constantly reducing the need for this., 
﻿a bigco that feels like a startup, + We're at the point where we can rip out startup-y code and take the time to do it right. + You can make genuinely impactful code changes even as an intern or very junior employee. There basically aren't pie-in-the-sky projects that will never see the light of day (*cough* Google) but we aren't flying by the seats of our pants either. It's a good balance. Your work will hit production and tens of thousands of people..., - Developer tooling is not quite mature particularly with regard to dev-prod parity staging and integration testing. It can be a little scary sometimes. Understandable with our rate of growth though. - A good bit of NIH syndrome with regard to developer tooling and infrastructure. Related to #1. You will usually *not* be able to Google your problem and internal documentation is hit-and-miss but you can probably..., 
﻿Rating system subjective and flawed, Unless your rating is over 4.8 there's no communication with the company and even where there is the changes they make are neither the ones which are most needed nor achieving the intended results; case in point the last app update. They were promoting it by saying that there would be no more need to tap to pick up or drop and that you could slide instead but we still have to do plenty of typing. Then there is the..., Change the rating system to pass or fail since that what it is. Have the customers enter an address. The current system sometimes sends me to pick up the customer several blocks and even as far as 7 minutes from his actual location. Invest more in the contractors who actually like their job and want to do this for a living and not just extra cash instead of spending so much money recruiting new drivers to make up..., 
﻿Driver, Meet great people most of the time., Undependable work schedule you never know how much you will make., 
﻿Great Place to Work, Great kitchen. Good team members. Very challenging environment., Expensive living costs in SF., Be more patient.
﻿Nice, , , 
﻿Great company so far. I have been with them for one month now, Very flexible and you make your schedule., Uber GPS is not the best. It's better to use google map, 
﻿Golden Age is over, Complete flexibility to work around your other gigs. Can make almost ok money if you drive peak times. Most riders are pretty decent to have on board., Driving during off-peak hours might mean hours without a fare averaging to less than minimum wage for the day. Partner app is very buggy navigation is poor., Add ability for riders to add tip on their credit cards. Improvements in Partner app for navigation accurate display of surge zones. Raise driver fares or lower Uber's commission. 20% is pretty hefty.
﻿Uber Driver, Flexible working hours good pay easy job you get to chat with people all day and listen to music work when you want to, Their payment system is terrible because they force you to join a large bank to receive the direct deposit. I have a credit union and I would never see the money in my account., Fix your payment system so that people who do not want to pay fees at banks and opt to use credit unions are no longer faced with this issue.
﻿Drivers are getting driven out by reduction in fares, It's great to just jump in your car any time you want and make some extra cash. You get to be a part of someone else's day and hopefully make it a little better., The money isn't there for drivers. And maybe Uber doesn't care since they've already stated they want to move to driver-less cars. But until Uber should either increase the fare rate or decrease the amount they take from the driver., Take care of your drivers.
﻿Uber...the real story behind the mask, Work when ever you want, Pay rate from the 1980's do not treat and respect there workers at all!!!, Give realistic pay and recieve tips. Dont be a corrupt company that lies to workers of high pay and make up lies of what we allegedly do!
﻿Reshaping the future, - There are few other places where you get a chance to make such a huge impact on people's everyday lives. - Uber has an army of the smartest most driven individuals giving their 100% towards the mission of reliable safe transportation. Success is not surprising its the obvious outcome., - When you're tackling the toughest problems in the world don't expect it to be easy. Work at Uber is hard and requires a lot of focus. Stress is common but its the nature of the beast., Uber has never cared for the naysayers keep it up.

﻿Deceptive Advertising reguarding earnings in order to attract new drivers., I am able to set my own schedule and locations where I want to drive; whenever I want to go to work all I have to do is get in my car and drive! There are no crazy controlling bosses to deal with and the customers that I have driven have so far been very kind and a pleasure to meet. I enjoy meeting new people and providing them with a safe and comfortable ride., Pay is low unless you drive at peak times. Peak times vary throughout the day and week. The amount of miles that you put on your car is insane and that really adds up to more out of pocket expenses that Uber wages just can't compensate for. The company advertises 19.00-25.00 an hour wage earnings if you sign up to drive. This is BS. You make this as a gross wage but then Uber takes their cut out and you are left..., BETTER PAY! Stop sending text messages to drivers begging for them to refer their friends to drive. We don't like our jobs and we tell our friends family and anyone who asks. Better partner (driver) support.
﻿swinging door, can work when you want; and be your own boss., terrible mileage on your vehicle the company won't help you if you need any real help. YOU COULD earn 1000 dollars a week in the city; however your going to work 12 hrs a day all week and put 4000 miles a month on your vehicle., Be a bit more helpful to the drivers like including tips and if s rider cancels share the cancellation FEE to the driver their the ones that drove for nothing...
﻿Great all around, You're working with a highly motivated team that focuses on moving fast and getting things done. Uber is just the right amount of startup combined with an operational machine that runs and works well. I've never seen a company expanding internationally at a pace and perfection like Uber does it. The team is great the CEO is great everybody is in it to win it., You'll love it so much you will not want to work for any other company any more! It's a startup and therefore doesn't have the 'convenience' benefits like a mature company does. Comes with other perks tho., Keep doing what you're doing.
﻿Uber is Great Until You Realize It's Not, -You're surrounded by highly intelligent and courteous people; - unlimited snacks beer all meals covered; - work on projects that affect people around the world;, -there's an inherent and subtle way in which contractors are made to feel inferior by being barred from certain areas and events from security guards not having access to certain tools to complete work to secure data (couldn't even use google docs for the first few months). I understand it's to protect trade secrets and such but definitely reminds you that you're not one of "them".; - depending on your role you may..., Actually manage your contractors and don't just treat them as the help
﻿Driver. Sf, Strangely... App can be hard to use passengers can be extremely rude or cocky no option for tips swirls weekends where a lot of money could potentially be made market ends up flooding., Give an option for tips, 
﻿Annoying waste of time, They will take anyone willing to bear all the responsibility/heavy lifting., You will not really make any money., Stop texting 100 million times.
﻿A Great Place to Work [July 2015], - there is an unlimited amount of cool stuff to do yet there is also work-life balance if you want it. - the antithesis of an "Office Space" culture. - feels like a startup probably thanks to the tight-nit city teams in a way that normal tech companies don't., - none at the moment., 
﻿Operations Manager, Culture is amazing - very entrepreneurial even as we have grown so quickly! Everyone is so passionate to help grow Uber and improve transportation all over the world. One of the company's best values is how everyone pushes one another to always raise the bar. Free lunches and the ability to work on some of the most interesting urban logistic problems in the world., None at the moment., Keep focusing on cultivating the entrepreneurial environment.
﻿Love this place!, I love the fast moving teams and the amount of influence we all have on our deliverables. It doesn't matter if you're a product manager designer engineer data scientist etc we all have a say in what we are working on in order to solve customer problems and create awesome experiences., None from me. Company is getting bigger so space may be an issue for some., I have full trust in our leadership team!
﻿Engineering, Upper management works just as hard as anyone else. There is a lot of excitement and energy that drives you every day. The transparency is unprecedented. The semi-yearly performance reviews ensure top talent rises. Every engineering team is brilliant and fascinating in its own right. There's so much impact to make on a daily basis and you are challenged to take risks and make a difference. And you will be rewarded for..., There should be more of a focus on education and training especially for new hires. Not everyone is going to realistically be self-driven enough to accelerate their learning and start contributing right away. But investing in training will benefit new hires and the engineering organization as a whole., We need to get more aggressive with our recruiting. There are incredible positions to fill and we should find ways to make ourselves more appealing to top candidates. Offer higher referral bounties for certain positions offer signing bonuses or incentives to interview with us. Once we get candidates in the door and informed about our technology and potential it's really difficult to turn us down.
﻿Poor contract employee service!, Set your own hours. Meet wonderful people! Learn your city roads., HORRIBLE service from Uber to their contract employees. Impossible to speak to a person. Can only send emails. Get poor response. For example I received a text message that my insurance was about to expire. i loaded it online. They suspended my service. I reloaded several times again. They turned it back on for a short period of time and then they suspended it AGAIN!! I've tried to contact them. It's impossible...., 
﻿#Superpumped, Working at Uber is exhilarating and rewarding. The company is full of the sharpest people I've met people are #superpumped to go to work and the management is communicative and inspiring. It's honestly so fun to come to work!, Although the work is worth it the hours are super long!, 
﻿Disrespectful staff, fast payment but really bad custommer service with unprofessional staff who doesn't care about drivers just the passengers. Well if you want to take a risk its up to you., Uber staff is really rude full towards driver if something happen. For exemple passengers vomit in my Car and when i send photos to Uber and ask for cleaning cost they refuses to pay although passenger was ready to pay me for cleaning cost. I never gonna use Uber. Remember all the drivers if any passenger destroy your car Uber is not gonna take a responsiblity for that. So you are own your own. Good luck, ............................................................................................................................................
﻿If you can get an offer take it!, Free health insurance. Catered lunches. Tons of Uber credits each month. Stock options. Perks aside one of the most challenging yet rewarding work environments I have ever been in. I feel like 6 months here equates to about 2 years of work experience at a "normal job." Would HIGHLY recommend it to anybody - especially those looking to fast track their career., Longer hours but that should be expected for a company growing so quickly like Uber., 
﻿Uber Driver, Work Whenever you Want/ Flexible Scheduele you are also able to fully live your life and get things done in between Uber drives., Independent Contractor/ TAXES/ You make most money during night/ You put in your own gas, N/A
﻿Easy job, Work at your own choosing. Always able to work at your own discretion. Good way to learn an area., Weak pay. Riders will waste a lot of your time if you wait at various stops for them to pick things up. The waiting pay doesn't benefit the driver at all it hurts your pay., Fix the pay to enable the drivers to actually make some money.
﻿Company of the decade, Uber is the place to be. You are surrounded by smart fun dedicated people who are changing the world. You are given autonomy and responsibility from Day 1. The work you do matters and you can see the impact., This isn't a lifestyle job -- you're going to be contributing a lot and everyone pitches in to make sure everything that needs to happen gets done. Not all parts of the job are glamorous either -- sometimes you've got to roll up your sleeves., Keep bringing on great people!
﻿Love it!, Fast paced culture that promotes innovation. Smart and passionate coworkers. Nurtures employees and focuses on their development., Frequent org changes as the company continues to grow., Maintain the current culture as the company continues to grow.
﻿Awesome company to work as an engineer., Opportunity: You're working with some of the greatest people in the industry. People come here from Google Twitter Facebook etc. to be a part of this. This isn't just an "IT company". There's real science and mathematics being applied to the environment and I'm learning more daily. Things are very un-siloed information is shared and available between teams. Also they have a policy of allowing horizontal moves between..., The constant sometimes negative media attention the company is getting makes some people apprehensive about working here., 
﻿Can't stop won't stop., Strong mission and game changing experience. This is just the beginning. One of the best CEOs in the business. He is principled fair and takes no excuses., Program Management. Let builders build. Don't get in the way and micromanage. Trust people., 
﻿Uber Suk!, You can work your own hours, They rob you everytime you get paid plus they charge you $10 per week to use and old iphone 4., Stop lowering the fares and stop charging drivers to use an outdated iphone with bad navigation system
﻿Diverse workplace with many interesting people, There are a lot of interesting people here. Coming from academia industry Google Facebook Amazon and many many more. I really enjoy hearing their stories and why they are where they are today., It's hard to say at this point because I'm just starting..., Stay Foolish Stay Hungry
﻿SuperPumped!, Great Tech Company to work for! I'm super pumped every day to work - A lot of the time it doesn't even feel like work because of the incredible things you're doing changing the way the world works. There are numerous opportunities to learn. If you want to grow a bunch at this company and learn new things you'll have the avenues to do so! I hope and expect to be with Uber for a long time!, The hours can get be pretty long however if you like working hard for a cause that you support then those hours won't even feel like work. I work many hours but love it!, Management needs to work harder at valuing and investing more into less experienced hires who are at the bottom of the totem pole expecting to work super hard learn lots and advance in the company. There is lots of room and potential for it.
﻿Terrible correspondence., Terrible support for their Uber partners. The team that works at corresponding through email with their driver partners have repeatedly proven to be incompetent at fully reading emails and understanding the needs being expressed. Highly ineffective and frustrating., Get it together with your partner support. Get a phone line; I know the text correspondence seems edgy effective and great but its super problematic when dealing with complicated issues that require explanation particularly when your support team is incompetence at fully responding to emails and understanding the needs at hand.

If you live in a city that's somewhat rural the driving distance can take it's toll on car wear and tear and gas etc. This job seems to really pay off if you live in a major metropolitan city such as San Francisco, Raise income for driver rather than cutting driver profits.

﻿Chance of a lifetime, i get to work with an insanely smart group of people on a very hard problem - changing transport in Sydney. Everybody is so motivated. City Teams at Uber are small so you get to be part of everything - In one day you could be working on marketing analytics meeting with drivers a press release interviewing new staff meeting an MP or literally painting a wall at the office., The taxi industry is putting up a pretty big fight so this grinds you down sometimes. Yes we all work very hard but there's flexibility around how it is done: you can work from home or cafe or whatever and make your own hours if you need to be somewhere personal., Make it easier to share the good ideas between all the cities around the world. Be sympathetic to different circumstances in the local markets.
﻿Great Place to Work at, Company is in hyper growth. So it's always busy. Management is helpful. Co-workers are nice., Commute to SF is my only concern right now. Sometimes work/life balance is a problem., Keep up the good work.
﻿Uber day driver info, , , 
﻿Over Rated!, Can drive on your own schedule., Uber takes 20% plus of every driver fares and on top of that does not consider wear and tear on driver auto's. The Uber application navigation system is fair at best and Uber Customers constantly complain about it., Take less of percentage of drivers fares and improve the navigation system on the application.

﻿Contradictions, Great way to earn income especially if you LIKE to drive rather than standing/sitting all day bored out of your mind. With Uber you get to move around the city and learn a lot about places you didn't even know existed while being paid to drive people there. The company seems pretty solid and is always battling to build out it's workforce against the wishes of dirty  overpriced cabs. They have a lot on their plate fighting..., The pin drop system is garbage and causes riders/passengers to rate each other poorly. Uber's training video tells you to keep your ratings up by getting to the passenger on time (even though the ETA is almost always wrong and doesn't account for traffic etc...). How can you be on time when the pin drop system takes you to the wrong address ALL THE FRIGGIN TIME! The passenger will drop your rating for it even though they..., Dump the stupid pin drop system...it is hurting your ratings as a company it hurts driver ratings it hurts passenger ratings it is damaging to the environment (all the extra waitingdriving). Put a camera in your vehicles and do a bunch of apt pick ups using the pin drop system and find out why it sucks. The cool thing about the app is that a rider doesn't even have to call or text a driver (IF THE ADDRESS THEY GAVE...
﻿Uber also known as !! You don't make more than $7 hour, There are no pros you don't make any money The most I made was $350 In a week after gas maintenance  taxes and wear and tear., The only way to contact them is via email they do not have chatbox or phone number. Very ancient thinking, Take care of your drivers. We will be conducting a strike in Florida soon for increasing rates Uber will take us seriously
﻿Hustle + Thrive, The company is moving extremely quickly and it does take hustle and fearlessness to do well here. Any idea is a valid idea it's a meritocracy., Longer hours than previous corporate jobs but worth it, 
﻿Great Company, the freedom is great and the pay is decent., you can only contact through email, 
﻿Brand Ambassador, Choose your schedule good compensation, Minimal training from upper management, 
﻿Ubwe, Great for maling your own hours. Never know who will gt in th car., Hard working 3am shift and hard on my car, Build in reachable inentives.
﻿Not what they advertise at all, Totally independent contractor make your own hours no minimum hours per week. No driver support or recognition by the company. Only other positive is that at the end of the year when tax time roles around you'll be negative when it comes down to the cost of doing business. So you shouldn't owe the IRS but the rest of your bills will be behind along the way., If you are looking to make a little side money this is not an easy route to go. Uber over hires and continues to drop their drivers per mile pay. High standards for UberSelect and UberXL line make it hard to qualify for which are the only lines that still pay a reasonable rate per mile $2.00 and $1.90 per mile respectively. They are not contracting with new drivers on UberBlack or UberSUV anymore. UberX only pays..., Treat your drivers as if they actually mean something a high turnover rate does not go well for the long run. Stop responding with copied and pasted answers and actually address the issues your drivers have as well. You get to ride for free and your hourly or salary pay comes from the backs of the drivers work so it makes since to actually be nice to us instead.
﻿Software Engineer, If I didn't work here and I knew what kind of work was going on at Uber I would be pretty sad. There is a ton of opportunity. There is a lot to learn. There is a lot to build. There is a lot to celebrate. I really can't think of another place I'd like to be., As we grow at our crazy rate we encounter problems. It is up to us to step up and fix those problems., Great company love it.
﻿Uber is fraud, Sale pitch be your own boss work whenever you want., You are contractor... trick of being your own boss. You invest huge amount of your own money by buying a brand new car only to find out in few months that fares are drop thousands of new drivers added in the system and now you can't even afford car payment even though you work 15 hours a day. .The results? You end up making way less than minimum wages and you start digging to your own saving account till money run out...., Stop cutting fares and diluting the market with more drivers. Uber will fall on it own weight when everybody know that drivers only make $2.10 on base fares after 15 minutes worth of work.
﻿This is the company I've always dreamed of working for., When I walk around the office I often think to myself: "How lucky am I to be working at the most valuable and innovative startup in the world? I seriously can't believe I'm here." + everyone is incredibly kind passionate and hardworking; people are always willing to answer your questions / help you when you need it + you're working alongside the smartest engineers in the WORLD and solving the toughest problems..., - projects are often underscoped - we're hiring/growing so fast that there are new faces in the office all the time (makes it hard to recognize people) - negative perception of Uber brand on the outside makes it hard to get recognition for all the good things Uber does as a company :(, 
﻿Review- Operations Consultant at Uber New Delhi, Great work culture fantastic set of peers office is good too pay is decent for a temp position, Repetitive monotonous work 6 day week office timings are long, 
﻿Great team great mission, - A lot of startups claim to be changing the world. Uber actually helps people in 300+ cities earn an income and get around. It doesn't get higher impact than that. - Great engineering. Uber is pushing the boundaries of what dynamically typed interpreted languages can do. It also picked up Node and Go when they were still very new and is now a leader in both. - Many problems the company faces can only be solved by..., Uber faces stiff competition in Asia. The company moves extremely face to get ahead which means the work is more challenging than at your typical Silicon Valley tech company., 
﻿Great opportunity, Nice atmosphere Great opportunity for career kick-off., Salary was not satisfying no future plans., Offer more insurance for future development.
﻿Great company to drive for, Great to drive for Uber. You can easily make upwards of $10K per month if you go out and drive especialyl during the surge hours. If you're lazy well 2-3 hours a day will net you about $100. So there's that., No cons really. It's much better than driving a taxi because fares are guaranteed paid with no hassle. The data usage is a killer though., Hope you give better incentive to drivers to stay on. I'm moving to Lyft because they offer great incentives and health insurance.

﻿Operations, It is so refreshing to work for a company where everyone is so passionate. Each employee is fighting to make Uber a better place everyday so that together we can make the world a better place. Together we are creating the processes and the change. Other pros: culture benefits opportunity, There is so much to be done that I have not found an optimal work life balance yet., Continue to promote on merit!
﻿Amazing company and opportunity, Amazing company that is moving at the speed of light, This place is a rocketship (not a bad thing :), 
﻿Ownership, You own the projects you take on. Said projects affect the real world. Crazy fun culture. Long hours but good hours. Paid opportunities to learn new skills., As I mentioned long hours but good hours. Growth means having to make rapid moves to a new desk or team., 
﻿Driver, Flexible schedule Drive whenever and however hours you want., They should cover gas., They should show destination of the person before picking them up.
﻿Partner, Super flexible and you van make a decent amount if your very disciplined abs know peak times, You're going to blow alot of money on gas if you don't have a prius, Get rid of the rider fee it's ridiculous especially on rides below five dollars
﻿Operations and Logistics Manager, The opportunity to succeed is yours. You are given amazing tools and the chance to make a real impact on a growing business. So it is really up to you. The culture and the people are beyond impressive. I am impressed each day. Astronauts Olympians Facebook Twitter Google Goldman Sachs you name it and there is someone at Uber who has been there and came here wanting more. The feedback mechanisms are comprehensive..., You need to work hard and smart to achieve great outcomes. Uber is just like any other., 
﻿Global Office with a Powerhouse Startup Feel, Super energised team agile and inventive approach to challenges Incredible growth potential Great office culture The team works hard and celebrates milestones Awesome perks! Seeing real impact on the world, Distance from HQ can sometimes be a strain Some challenges around bad press but proud to have an awesome Legal and Comms team who are always on top of it, Continue to recognise hard work and align the team to common goals.
﻿Shared Ride Driver, Easy to sign up for. Flexible Schedule. No problems with getting paid. You get to rate and report abusive riders and the company stands behind there drivers verses the customers., A little dangerous due to public contact., Thanks for having your drivers back.
﻿Still feels like a start-up ... things get done!, Fast-moving ownership culture -- you build what you want launch it out iterate quickly make an impact. I previously worked at Google which is a fantastic place but it moves so slowly due to it being a permission culture (where everything needs approval). At Uber I'm free to make decisions and own the outcome which means we can move really quickly. I feel young again!, The company is growing so rapidly that often we face situations or opportunities for which there is no plan. You need to be comfortable with ambiguity and not being afraid to just step up and fill the void. Most start-up & entrepreneurial folks love this but others find it a con., As we grow please continue to look at further and further horizons ... there's so many day-to-day opportunities that compete for resources that we need to be deliberate about protecting our longer-term investments.
﻿Uber is the best job I, I get to problem solve every day with a super smart driven team. We're empowered to make decisions execute and share learnings. We're improving the cities that Uber operates in - it's exciting to come to work every single day!, Hours can be long but they go very fast! There aren't enough of them in the day., Great job - keep it up!
﻿Can't imagine a more exciting co to work for, Uber is growing incredibly quickly and radically changing the way people move around cities. This is made possible by an awesome team. How many opportunities to you get to completely shake up an industry?! Dream job if you want to be surrounded by incredibly talented people and you thrive on ownership and autonomy. Every 3-6 months feels like a new role. Culture of innovation best idea wins and helping each other..., Will be expected to work hard but everyone is in control of their time - no face time culture. You will most likely go to bed and wake up thinking about Uber. Fast past is not for everyone., Never drop the talent bar - keep hiring the best.
﻿Fulltime student, Try lyft first the uber..., Dont pay on time. Its been two weeks since ive received my first or second check now third.Poor communication especially when they call u but u cant call them back. Then i just found out Uber uses Raiser which uses Bill.com . Hit do ur info on companys that rips the drivers off and check out whats Uber Gross every year..., Law suite coming from a driver in Atlanta
﻿Unlike Anywhere Else - Great Experience!, Awesome culture and experience still has that startup feel where no two days are the same which makes working for Uber especially exciting. The best part (for me) is being able to surround yourself with highly driven and successful intelligent people. Uber offers so many opportunities to its employees and interns including exposure and participation in some really awesome events promotions and behind the scenes going-ons..., There aren't really many cons if any being an intern! There's plenty of flexibility - so you don't really have to worry about the work/life balance as mentioned in other reviews. Possibly the only con is not getting some of the benefits full-time team members get - but they hard work for it and there are plenty of benefits for an intern as is!, Keep doing what you do exactly how you do it! Be sure to maintain the awesome culture of Uber as it grows and grows!
﻿Rather sell lemonade, There are no pros except you can log out and go home when you want. Complete lying scam artist., No moneyno moneyno moneyno money did I mention you will not make any money. You will spend most of your time hovering around like a lost dog. When you do get trips they dont even cover lunch or gas. Actually thats all they cover your working for peanuts. Run your car in the ground but hey once you dont have a car you can call uber their cheap., Keep finding desperate people to drive for wages that you know they will never make. I hope the word spreads fast and you all end up getting sued.
﻿Horrible cheap company, None. This company is a complete scam., I'm very lucky if I make 10 dollars ph before gas. The customers don't tip because they are cheap and they are told that tip are included?! WTF! How is making 2.75 after uber fares for a ride that took me 20+ minutes inducing pickup including a tip?! I'm not even making minimum wage. The only people driving for uber are desperate. I would make more money spare changing on a street corner., Quit being such corporate greedy jerks! Pay your drivers a living wage and encourage riders to tip!
﻿salary, works around your schedule easy money, boring at times otherwise good job, 
﻿Amazing for those in-between jobs, you choose your schedule the pay is way better than any other temp job you might find! Driver smarter not harder and you can make great money!, If you need serious help or questions answered there is no number to call expect email to take 24hrs, 
﻿Quick moving humble culture, - We move fast. Really fast. - Engineering org culture of helpfulness and humility - Use the latest technologies and work with very smart people, - Sometimes move too fast, Less churn
﻿Many of These Reviews are Phony!, Anyone notice how the majority of these reviews are by employees who work inside and not in the field? Yeh... I BET you like getting paid BIG bucks to sit on your tush and make nice paychecks! What are the DRIVERS making? Peanuts!! Below min. wage! No wonder you get paid so well and enjoy your little techie positions. These reviews are either phony and driven by a workforce of people hired to publish them or published..., When I worked for this company my experience was that of very poor treatment! The pay is equal to that of a 3rd world country! As a former driver to see these reviews... it is a BIG RED FLAG to me since I know the truth. These reviews are nothing more than a false image campaign. Driver turnover is astronomical because only a fool would work for pennies like that! When you consider the expenses you have as a driver......, None! They already know what they are doing to people and don't care so let'em improve their game or let'em crash and burn!

﻿Make the minimum fare at least $7.00, To me most down side is NO TIPS. when you give nice service we expect tips in USA but Uber said tips is not require., Make the minimum fare at least $7.00. current minimum fare is only $4.00. we don't make anything from out of that. I mean if you deduct $1 rider fee %20 uber fee basically we are making $2.40 where is car miles and time. Think about that. I am sure if you rise the minimum fare there will more driver on the Road. Thank you Ahmed, 
﻿Amazing thing to be a part of, Could not be happier! I left a big-company corporate environment to come to Uber and it has been life changing. The level of ownership and responsibility given to you from Day 1 is unparalleled. I actually want to come to work and sometimes work feels like that good book that you just can't put down at the end of the night. The team is young smart dynamic and has your back. Not once have I seen an instance of..., No cons I love this company., Keep the small company feel you have somehow managed to maintain at the insane growth rates we are experiencing. Every city feels like it's own small startup (but with the resources and support of a much bigger organization) and that's an amazing thing.

﻿Not fare and trustful company and bad management, flexible for time  when ever you want to work you can work, the rating system is not based on fixed points and sometimes they send wrong directions and then the rider and driver facing problems together not stable work as they can end your account any time not easy to contact them to solve any problem, 
﻿World-changing company with incredible potential, 1) Tons of upside 2) Many opportunities for career growth 3) Results-oriented culture 4) Passionate co-workers, 1) Fast intense pace is not for everyone 2) Must be able to handle ambiguity and independence well, Might be worthwhile to soften our outward image to help recruiting.
﻿uber driver, Flexible work schedule No need for an interview Feels Pretty safe as a woman driver, They take 20% plus you are responsible for paying taxes No live customer service agents If there is an issue with any of your documents you can be unable to work for long periods of time while they review your documents. Would not do this job full time unless you absolutely had to, Get a live call center. Emails don't work very well.

﻿Transactions, Great Company Fast paced hit the ground running, Still very new so many of the processes have to be built, 
﻿So far I have not too many issues with if, Flexible hours make pretty decent money during surge pricing get to do a lot of reading while waiting around for riders to ping, Ubered for 4 hours the other day and only made ~$20 a few weeks before during surge pricing I made $55 in about 2 hours. I am not a full time driver but I imagine if you are doing this full time the money isn't all that great. Part time during surge hours especially at 2am when the bars are closing is prime money though. The rating system needs work. Passengers leave ratings but aren't required to leave explanations..., Work on the ratings system to where drivers can know better what they needs to do to be better drivers. Give high pay to those who drive more maybe as an incentive to drive during non-surge hours and days.
﻿Flexible hours horrible pay, You can pick your own hours and work as little or as much as you want. It's great for filling in downtime between your regular job's hours., No employee benefits even though they set strict guidelines on how to do your work. The earnings are in no way a living wage; the only way to make a profit is to deduct your mileage from your taxes., Either change drivers' status to employee or stop taking such a large cut from our income. Include a tip option in the rider app since few people carry cash anymore and many riders want to tip drivers.

﻿Operations and Logistics Manager, Love working with partners. I have a great sense of ownership in driving the business. Enjoy solving real problems., We are very reactionary we don't have a great strategic plan at the city level. Crazy amount of work and number of hours needed to be successful is enormous., We are working on this but we need for more people as fast as possible.
﻿CSR Review, Set your schedule work from home flexible hours., You're an independent contractor not an employee., 
﻿Driver, -Flexibility - Company Support - Decent Pay, - Wear and tear on personal car - Long hours in vehicle -, 
﻿Fantastic for home offices, No commute in traffic. No handling angry issues by phone. Great pay for a stay at home job., Different managers will get you different answers. Others will "cherry pick" tickets to respond to which makes it hard to make your hourly goal., Take steps to ensure everyone is answering the oldest inquiries first. Nobody wants to work on length multiple complaint tickets constantly because other employees get away with skipping over those.
﻿Unparalleled Growth=Unlimited Potential, - Extremely fast paced and exciting environment. - The people are hands-down amazing super intelligent creative and diverse. - The culture is extremely special (representative of the people who work here). - Constantly changing the world with limitless future potential., - Hours are very long and difficult but the challenge is greatly appreciated by highly-driven and motivated individuals. Having come from other start-ups that were moving a break-neck speed (relatively speaking) the speed at Uber blows them all away., Maintain a culture of continuous building and shipping great products - do whatever it takes to keep the ship from slowing down.
﻿Driver Partner, Flexible easy to use technology pay is consistent and timely. Partner events occasionally give out free stuff. I can choose my own hours which is nice., Need to raise rates for drivers because the minimum rate is too low. Need to increase Uber plus volume or automatically increase rates when people receive an upgraded ride for free., Fix the surge issue where surge never stays on when drivers transition over to a surge area. It is a waste of gas and unfair to every driver that goes over there. If a driver is in transition to a surge area they should be guaranteed the surge price locked in.
﻿Not cool., The pay is nice and working from home is great. Hands off management is cool too I suppose., Constant change and the overseas workers are very bad at their jobs so your job is basically just cleaning up their mess. They are phasing out all the work from home workers in the US so they can take over too. You never know when someone is going to disappear and nobody will tell you what's going on. No heads up whatsoever about your contract being extended. I've met with my manager twice in 6 months. No values., Try managing.
﻿Lack of communication, Amazingly flexible schedules great pay, Expectations not verbalized at any point no manager reviews, Communication between tech support crew and management needs to be much better
﻿Right Idea Wrong People, Flexible hours Meet interesting people and sometimes good networking happens. Explore town. Not knowing where you'll end up is pretty fun, The pay has been cut in half over the past year. Yet Uber adds a "Safe Rides Fee" to protect their profits. Drivers get no such protection. This results in Uber taking about 30% of fares instead of 20%. Uber Support continually sends form letters to drivers so if you want a genuine response to a concern you're out of luck. After gas wear and what not net income is MINIMUM WAGE. And you get to drive your car..., I don't know what to say to management. They know they don't have to change. They're too big and too many people want to drivers so they know they don't have to lift a finger on behalf of the current drivers.
﻿Driving uberx, Great demandservice and status pays on time, Very bad customer Service for drivers, Telephone availability todrivers
﻿Review of Uber as a driver, Work on your own time somewhat flexible schedule. Decent pay. They have a headquarters in Denver. Quick email response. Good for some part time extra cash I would not recommend full-time., Shady company they tell the costumers tip is included. You won't make as much as they say. There are fees that add up. Serous wear and tear on your vehicle., Raise the price per mile to something where we make more then pennies after hour tax deduction. Maybe back to 1.64 like when I started. Also raise the minimum fair of the 4 dollars paid by the customer we only see 2.30. That's ridiculous.
﻿Design Lead, - Unlimited Vacation Policy - Equity options are available - Learn quickly and build a large network - Work directly with the community you are seeking to serve - Gain feedback and metrics reports on the performance of your products - Autonomy is encouraged to help you build create and test new solutions - Rapid design and implementation process helps your designs get to market quickly - Positively improve..., - Bring your A game everyday because you will be challenged and questioned frequently - Lots of people equals highly competitive culture, Management seems a bit detached from the leads that they support. This can be seen as a good/bad thing. Good because you have more autonomy and less reporting to do. Bad because you may not have them around to support you immediately when needed. My advice to management is to provide more expectation and support to the leads they work with.
﻿Great Company, Fast expanding company quality employees technologically advanced, Long hours constant focus required difficult to keep up with the pace, 
﻿Hiring process, Great environment lots of perks and room for growth., It will be great if UBER can make all the efforts possible to start an employee match on their 401K plan., Be more flexible with the hiring process!! give a variety of people the opportunity to apply. I feel that you are only concentrating on employees with international background but your factors should be concentrate more on years of experience and background.
﻿Uber driver, Go to work when I want with no strings. Make money for my family and not someone else's. Meeting interesting people and providing a service., Short rides that cost me money while Uber still profits. Less than rewarding reward program that basically offers nothing. Rating system that can only go one real direction DOWN, Remove rating system as it stands it's unfair and yes I unders it's based on 500 which means to get back a 5 you need 500 in a row good looking ck. raise rates up to 6 dollars and surge when it takes over 10 to pick someone up
﻿bad people in an exploitive system, quick money and no boss, evil and exploitive environment they taunt you if you complain, don't be so caviler with driver's welfare
﻿Pay not as promised, -Work whenever you want -opportunity to meet new people -no experience needed -helps keep drunk people off the road, Working peak hours after all is said and done has equated me $14-20 dollars an hour before consideration of gas and wear and tear on my vehicle. Uber advertises that you can make $25+ an hour and I don't see how this is possible. People often take trips using the minimum required payment which is $4 after uber fees you are left with $2.40. This wouldn't be so bad if you didn't factor in the 4-8 minutes it takes to pick..., The rider fee kills drivers profit Ill be moving on to Lyft which encourages tipping and pays better.
﻿Worthwhile but sometimes stressful, Incredible growth leads to really interesting scaling challenges Most ambitious place I've ever worked. Fantastic long term vision. Smart passionate coworkers, Growing fast comes w/ growing pains. Technical debt and some long nights., Make sure you reward/acknowledge long hard pushes and watch for burn out.
﻿Uber Technologies, You can work as much as you like., You are Freelance only by name. They are controlling everything., 
﻿love it, Uber Driver App's navi system is sometimes not quick enough to respond when there's a large interchange on the highway as far as showing which of the several forks to take. Also zooms in very erratically making it hard sometimes to see exactly where to turn. It's works well enough enough of the time but it's still waaay less intuitive than Google Maps, Modernize the GPS ASAP plz. Damn this 20 word minimum what's wrong with saying everything I need to say in 5 words?, 
﻿Uber Cares!!, Great place to work! Many perks! Friendly people! Ability to provide input since the company is growing at a fast pace! There is plenty of room for growth. Management leads they don't micro-manage!! Nice environment., Work / life balance is difficult for some since support to the Uber community is high demand on the weekends., Although support is required on the weekend employees should work one weekend day as opposed to both in order to have work/life balance. Other than that the place is great.
﻿Exciting place to work wonderful engineering culture., As a software engineer at Uber I get to work on products that ship to millions of users and improve their lives in a very tangible way. We are constantly innovating designing new products and features and shipping them fast. Our roadmap is heavily data-driven and we use the information we collect to make informed decisions about what works and what doesn't. Engineers at Uber have a lot of say in how products are architected..., To be honest the only thing that is at times frustrating is that at the rate at which we're growing we all have to spend a lot of time onboarding new employees and getting them up to speed on our projects and processes. This is a good problem to have though :), 
﻿Not great.., low rates high fees charged by Uber. Heavy mileage on vehicle (average 200 miles/day), raise prices, 
﻿driver, flexible scheduling so i can have other jobs, they don't pay enough to cover my gas riskor wear and tear on car., charge clients more pay better allow tipping
﻿Helper, Never 8n the same spot, Long days and nights, The owner is very unlikely professional
﻿Uber company review, Great company! Loved my time there. Had to leave as moving country with family. Would love to work with them again if I could at my new location but not currently started up here. Dynamic growing quickly young freedom to try new things., Lacks a bit of structure fast growth can be a bit chaotic sometimes., 
﻿great, great company to work for couldn't be happier, none to speak of everything is explained extremely well up front, 
﻿Generally good company, The hours are of your own making; when the going is good quite a lot of money can be made in a short period of time; if you need to take time off that is very much not a problem., The pay structure is constantly changing and if you disagree with the new terms well tough luck. While a lot of money can be made on weekends week days and nights can be a terrible waste of time. There is also no compensation for driving long distances to pick up fares so in a slow time that can make for barely breaking even for the ride., The drivers could be treated more reliably as they are the ones keeping the company going on a daily basis.
﻿Insurance ambiguity no transparency, Choose your own hours easy to sign up and get started, Uber will let you sign up to drive with any personal auto insurance. Unfortunately the strong majority of insurance providers DO NOT allow your vehicle to be used for ride sharing no exceptions. Despite this Uber will happily activate your account with no disclaimer about this issue. I called my insurer (Geico) and was told I need to terminate my affiliation with Uber to maintain my current coverage at my current..., Work on your transparency. Inform drivers that most (if not all) companies have a zero tolerance policy on using your vehicle with personal auto insurance for ride sharing and it may void your contract. Tell them to contact their insurance companies before they sign up to drive or better yet make it mandatory. Or continue to lack transparency and watch your reputation crumble.
﻿Stop Driving for Uber, Basically nothing. You can choose your own hours, They take 25% of each ride. Terrible costumer Service and they do not care about their drivers, 
﻿Don't work here, Work when you want to, You buy gas you buy everything customer always right syndrome, Take away conditions for you guarantees. If you are online you get paid regardless of ride restrictions
﻿Rating One Star, It's fun when there are people who want rides and being paid by direct deposit into my checking account is a plus., An extremely elitist unscrupulous and intolerant company.....They are very evasive when it comes to communication with drivers......Resulting in a feeling of disconnection....Problems at the core of the company are reflected by drivers who are then subject to being rated and discharged without any prior warning or second chance ...Even though they do not provide training or allow for a period of adjustment they expect..., The communication with drivers is too evasive. If you are not going to provide training then the rating system is invalid.....
﻿Driver Partner Position, The only downside is that you can never guarantee you will make a specific amount in any given time frame., I would suggest offering partners more recognition for positively contributing to the company and brand., 
﻿Uber is not so uber great, Flexibility. That's about it. You can drive anytime and be anywhere in the city. Most but not all passengers are cool., I started working for them in 2013. Back then it was a fun and a well paid gig. Over the years Uber has been giving drivers the shaft to the point that driving costs more or close to it than what is earned. It's like driving at minimum wage and you end up wearing out your car too. Despite all of the millions if not billions of dollars that Uber received from investors Uber mgm't is not using any of those dollars..., Take care of your drivers. Give them real support so driving results in good pay and profit not financial net negative.
﻿driver/partner, can work when you want where you want no restrictions. No supervisor. Just some basic rules you need to be aware of. Good way to make a few bucks (not a lot) if you can't find a job anywhere else., A lot. Aside from it being fairly easy to do. You're really not paid much for what you do. Yes you could easily make a few hundred bucks in a weekend but it's going to have to be late night on the weekends and dealing mostly with drunks who don't respect that this is your personal vehicle. Then after you subtract gas and figure in wear and tear you're really only making about $10.00 an hour. Then if you have any questions..., Uber itself is a great concept and appears to be a great company for everyone inside. The main thing I would tell management is to find a way to compensate drivers better. Yes drivers are a dime a dozen and can be found and trained easily. But that just means there's a high turnover rate. That will come back and haunt you over time. If it weren't for drivers there wouldn't be a company. Yet the drivers are the least respected.
﻿Self employment, Flexibility!! You choose when you want to work. Meeting new people. More hrs you work the more money you make., Wear and tear on your car do own taxes drunks stuck in traffic it can be very slow at times., Support and driver incentives
﻿It's what you make of it, Set your own hours work as much or as little as you want., Tendancy to over work or under work when you don't feel like it. Having people in your car and personal space., None. I don't see how the company could help drivers other than raising rates by with today's marketplace for rideshare options I don't see that happening anytime soon.
﻿Could be better, flexible hours and friendly people, zero benefits employee covers all costs of operation with no protection, actually hire people
﻿Currently the best platform to drive on, Lots of passenger requests. Highest average gross per ride. Customer support is faster and better than Lyft and Sidecar. Nice bonus opportunities., They take a huge chunk of commission per ride. 28% on UberXL! 25% on UberX and UberPool! Not as many perks as Lyft. No ability to control pickup and drop-off radius nor ability to set fare pricing like Sidecar, If you guys could charge only 20% commission like Lyft and Sidecar I would be #TeamUber all the way! Giving us the ability to earn our the commission back like Lyft I'd put Uber ads in and on my car. If you added Sidecar's controls like pickup and drop-off radius and setting the driver rates I'd be ride or die Uber for life!
﻿Driving for uber, Make your own schedule  be your own boss, Pay is so so  rating is not explained. No benefits at all., Lower your fees for long time drivers. Raise minimum fee .
﻿Customer Service Rep, Flexible hours remote work pay, weekly video meetings boring micro management much?, 
﻿Poor management, Work whenever you want cool coupons if you drive enough get decent money in busy cities., The support team (email) Process for background checks -Born and raised in America -Served in the military -Not a criminal It's taken about 2 months for them to approve my account for me to drive., Fix your support team.
﻿New Driver, easy money make your own hours Make as much as you want weekly pay check. Driver services respond fairly quickly, have to pay own taxes maintain own vehicle not enough benefits for drivers., 
﻿don't do it in memphis, flexibility and meeting new people, oversaturated cannot make money to survive, make it better for "partners"
﻿Exciting career epic business top engineering talent, - Very sharp engineers driven to succeed. - Lots of engineers from other top tech companies like Facebook Google Apple Amazon etc. This gives us the ability to replicate what makes sense and leave behind what doesn't. It's a fresh start. - The overall mission of the company makes total sense. - Being a part of an epic disruption story is exciting. - Revenues are astronomic in uncharted territory for a start-up..., - If you don't live in SF your commute will suck., - Go IPO while the market is hot ride the wave. We are in it for the long term either way.
﻿Worked as a driver, flexible scheduling good money easy job fun job unlimited time off no overhead drive your own car use their phone, it was difficult dealing with the disparity of having your own phone and their phone. but they have since changed this, I have no advice to give to management. I thought it was great. I came from Lyft and loved the extra attention I got when I was registering
﻿Uber, Working with Uber gives opportunities to drviers to earn that much of a money in which they know working harder is getting much much more money., sometimes customers are drunk and they do not act normal, 
﻿Driver, very flexible hours interesting work, low hourly rates surge pricing poorly implemented, encourage tips for better rider/driver relations stop promotions that come out of drivers pocket
﻿EXCELLENT, Being able to have a good time while I do what I enjoy 🎒, Meeting and greeting peoples from all walks of life 🎒, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK 🎒
﻿strcitly part time and that's all you can do otherwise suffer, no schedule to follow and work when you want to 24/7, absolutely NO benefits and your employment rest's on solely on passenger critique on a five star scale which is totally insane and Uber should change for real full time drivers who are totally vested in driving for Uber!, Uber should only charge 8 up to 10 percent in driver fee's otherwise give full time drivers FULL benefits (medical-dental the works) and eliminate 5star ratings and change it a real and serious scaling system not the this current mickey-mouse rating system they have now.
﻿Engineer, Engineering team moves very fast; The product is very exiting; Engineers there have chance to work on from frontend to backend., Work/life balance needs improve. Some managers have no vision what the team should do., Some managers have no any management experience and skills. They need improve their soft skills before running a team.
﻿Great job if you don't need stability or job security., Wonderful team members great management great company to work for, Contract renewals are sporadic not based on metrics and don't make much sense. 3 month contracts don't allow for a healthy life., Address rumors. People are happier when they feel secure and knowledgeable about their positions.
﻿Good gig for a little extra money on the side., The flexibility is great as well as the weekly pay into your account., The amount of gas spent doesn't really make it worth it as a full time job. Plus the amount they claim you can make isn't really realistic unless you work 50 plus hours a week., Allow the option to tip the driver and work on better compensation for your drivers.
﻿Excellent experience, Flexible schedule no boss no coworkers no minimum requirementmeet lots of interesting people. If you like freedom this job is perfect for you., Strict rating system your account could be deactivated for disrespectful riders. The company keeps hiring drivers so it makes the business very slow sometimes., 
﻿Worst company to join, The reason I was attracted was its startup market. Each region has relative autonomy so there's a good degree of breathing space. I also liked the company's overall vision., They treat their employees like they treat their drivers: subservient. I've never interviewed somewhere where I actually felt like the interviewers were against me. I should have taken that as a red flag but I joined anyways and quit a month later., Change the culture or keep churning employees.
﻿Community Support Representative, Great company. Interview was easy. 2 phone interviews then a Skype interview. The whole process took a week. I applied on Monday did all interviews that week and was hired the following Monday., Have yet to see the cons. Only thing don't care for is the schedule. 4x10 and at least a Saturday or Sunday will be worked., 
﻿Uber, Great for college students looking for part time job., Nothing really. Just allow tipping to drivers., Please allow tipping.
﻿Not worth it, You work your own hours You meet new people in your community, Pay is nothing after the 20% commission and gas etc. They discourage tipping, Add tipping to the app Increase the fare rates
﻿Great Opportunity if you are young and hungry, , , 
﻿Contract worked review, Great work place to enhance your career., Poor prospects of promotion., 
﻿Uber driver, Flexible schedule work when you want., The drivers pay is less than minimum wage when you take into account that you have to work at least 12 hours daily 6 days a week to make $800 for yourself. And now the company is adopting all the requisites that the taxi companies have imposed on them by the City of Chicago. It is a pain in the neck to deal with all those requisites and the customers rate you low just to be mean. The uber driver pays all the expenses..., Stop imposing taxi like regulations on uber drivers or the business model will ultimately fail.
﻿Driver, You can make your own schedule and you get to meet lots of interesting people., The rating system is messed up. If you get 4 out of fives consistently you can get canned pretty quickly., Keep up the good work with customer support and consider lowing the rating system.
﻿Very disappointed, I was hired to do Driver Support via email. Overall I liked the job for most support answers were easy to find and help. Loved that they were flexible with scheduling., Lack of organization had gotten several emails earlier in the week that my stats were very good to feel free to do overtime and also take training for 'Tier 2". Then got a call a couple days later letting me go because my stats weren't good enough. Just crazy., Get some older more experienced in business people to help you. Too many young people with no real experience running the place.
﻿Great...but, No boss very flexible you make your own hours meet great people ability to network with others. Also a great environment because your in your own space!, The App has glitches from time to time sometimes hard to capitalize on surge offers even though you are in the zone you can get requests that take 15 mins for a short $5.00 trip...etc, Listen to partners when they have suggestions try to improve with communication with drivers who have issues.
﻿I'm a concierge counselor and chauffeur for fratboys., flexible work schedule decent pay entertaining fun take breaks when I want to I'm my own boss, cleaning my car paying for my own gas no health benefits rude customers rating system if my car doesn't work I don't work, 
﻿The ABSOFRIGGIN WORST. (Don't believe the hype….ever ask yourself why the annoying repeated ads ALL over Craigslist?, Pros all go to Uber, Cons….the whole endeavor. Listen it's a racket you won't ever win at., Get real….

﻿Independent Driver, Good pay and flexible., Focus on customer more than the drivers, focus on both the customer and drivres
﻿Great Job. Make as much as you want to work., Make money every day you work., You have to work it or you won't make very much. You have to get out there and drive, Thank you for this wonderful opportunity it really saved my family. We can survive while we look for the right job instead of just grabbing the first available
﻿High Performance Culture, Uber has some of the smartest people in the valley. Everyone across the company in all the units works incredibly hard and doing extra-ordinary things. Everyone is on a mission!, This is not for people who are looking for a comfortable and stable job and want to get by. You will have to work hard be smart and work long. It might take a hit on your work-life balance., Keep the same engineering culture. Continue hiring the smartest people and never let the bar go down.
﻿Uber gives you the Platform....you bring the Drive., Schedule flexibility Income possibilities Meet great people, Remember it's still the service industry...so your still gonna deal with scrappy people., Please look after the guys lessening cars from other "transportation" companies.
﻿Driver, Love the felixablitiy. You get to meet cool people and hear interesting story., The pay is absolutely horrendous. I think my car depreciates more than I earn. There are some infuriating passengers that you got to deal with that treat your car like crap., The pay structure need to be change to accounted for depreciation. You guys plan to hoard cash and later convert to a fleet of driverless cars. It doesn't mean you can screw over the drivers now. I don't understand why you guys get to gouge 20% of the fare from drivers. Why do you get to keep 1 dollar and other times 12 dollars from doing the same amount of work?
﻿You are not a partner, Get to meet a lot of people, Company will stab you in the back in a heart beat, Listen to your drivers
﻿Great! better than expected, Drove for uber while working 2 other jobs and as a full time student. Still able to easily find time to earn some extra cash. Able to meet other wonderful people as well. Sometimes would travel over 100 miles to see family in san diego and was still able to work uber at night, App can be glitchy at times you really dont need it to. They do not take out taxes for you either so its important to take out that information before hand and put that money aside. If not youll be in trouble during tax time. a little difficult to get in contact with management when you need them, Start taking out taxes for uber drivers or being more open about that process like in the training video. Also Be better a making Uber more accessible
﻿Great if you live downtown in select cities. Otherwise don, Flexible Hours Be your own boss. Surge Pricing + $$$!!! Sounds great right? I can't stress enough how great it was when I first started working for them in 2013. Then it all went downhill, Expect to live life in your car competing with the thousands of other people desperate for money. Working for Uber used to be profitable but now that they have more drivers than customers (and more competition from Lyft / Taxi companies) you'd barely be making money after all the gas maintenance cleaning and higher insurance costs. Not to mention that there are no benefits to speak of. Surge Pricing is great..., Stop making false promises and be honest with the people you hire. This is really a great service for the customers but the drivers get treated like crap and there's very little consistency or support.
﻿Okay, Good money during surge pricing Flexibility, Rating system stinks Money sucks outside of surge hours, Fix rating system
﻿Driver, You manage your own time and have freedom to work when you need to. It is a very organized system that lets you be your own boss and feel good about your life., It is very tedious work and takes some patience to drive around the city. Traffic can be an issue in big cities but the pros outweigh the cons when you realize you are actually working for yourself., The app needs a little work and also the people that are hired to sign people up are rude. Probably because it is every man for himself. There is an evident lack of structure and work etiquette.
﻿Driver, You get to make your own Schedule, Can only make decent money during busy hours., Raise fairs. Right now we are 40% of what a cab costs. We could be 70% and still crush the competition. Then I would Uber Full Time.
﻿So Far so Good, Own schedule take breaks as needed. meet new people, Traffic can be a headache., n/a
﻿Cool product incompetent management., Really interesting work impacting millions of users globally. Very cool to be part of something so big. You get free ride credits which is really nice., Managers are incompetent and can't guide advise or control their employees. You'll be asked to make decisions you aren't qualified to make.... unless you're getting backlash for demonstrating too much independent thought and initiative. Competent people are encouraged to leave if they don't match an arbitrary and unspoken standard (which will be framed as having "performance issues"). Budget is tight fisted and benefits..., Clean house. Get managers who can be decisive and directive. Make employee expectations and standards explicit from the get-go.
﻿Uber takes more than 20% of your money and you get no tips., You can work whenever you want., The company takes 20% or more of your fare for letting you use their app plus 1 dollar per fare and you get no tips through the app either. After all your expenses from gas maintenence etc. you aren't left with much., Uber's cut of 20% of the fare for letting you use the app(gps) is too high. Stop taking 1 dollar per fare and give it back to the driver. Create a way for drivers to earn tips through the app like LYFT does. Do the math it's rape and karma will come back to you. Make these changes to create less turnover and more incentives for the driver. Create a culture where drivers are happy and stay with UBER and become experienced...
﻿driver, only pro is the fact of working when ever for as long as you want. I work sat nights only and average 100.00-150.00 from 8pm to 2am sat night ONLY! so I only drive sat nights., cut pay twice in 10 months. too many drivers plus lower pay equals a bad job with streaks of good money! sat. nights are still profitable otherwise forget making even 8.00 an hour the rest of the week., pay the drivers what they are worth stop telling lies about lowering rates makes more money! NOT TRUE!!!!!
﻿Uber Diver, It's fun set your own hours no boss and you are in your own car. It's really great., It's hard to get paperwork through and updated sometimes other times it's approved in minutes., I don't get invited to a lot of local events maybe I am missing the invites but keep working on the communication.
﻿Started out great but quickly went down hill., It was a fun collaborative team environment at first high energy and they gave us a sense that we were going to be able to contribute to something great. We were encouraged to add the human element in our customer service communications and we felt appreciated. This company has alot of moxy and they can make tough decisions., Like I said it was a fun collaborative team environment at first then they started to pull back on the responsibilities they first gave the customer service team members. They started adding unnecessary layers of micromanagers to the CSR Team training began to get more mucky and then it happened. Next they outsourced the CSR team to a temporary agency (we were employees of Uber at first) Outsourcing customer..., There's nothing you can tell leadership at this particular company because they think they got it all figured out and maybe they have. I do give the founders credit for where they've taken it from an idea to where it is now but they've lost alot along the way.
﻿Driver, Uber is great if you have a car that is great on gas and if you put the time into it. I got constant alerts for pick ups and never had to wait long for my next job., For someone with a luxury car this is not a great opportunity while working at uber i made little to no money after gas. I continued driving because i was told after 30 days i can switch to UberSelect but i ended up finding out my car is not on the approved list even though i was told otherwise., Have management communicate clearly with your drivers and allow luxury cars to skip past uberx so the drivers can make a decent wage.
﻿Uber Breaks Every Rule = UBER, Flexible working hours few knowledgeable passengers, low fare no tips no pay for dead miles, Uber will be a history soon once other big names with good reputation join to grab the market. They are ready but do not want to step in at this moment because they are watching Uber fighting with all the lawsuits. Unless ride-share business is 100% legalized these good companies will not join the muddy water.
﻿Great company, Low salaries very old-school traditionally educated managers that are afraid of unconventional yet motivated and educated people, Take more risks with projects with unconventional people etc., 
﻿It is what you make it., You get paid weekly you don't have to handle money so you shouldn't have to worry about any BS. You get to meet some cool people....well I do. You get off when you want to. You work when you want to., You can't see where the rider wants to go you just know that they entered their destination. Too many text messages telling me whats going on....its worst than a nagging girlfriend. Its wear and tear on your own vehicle. Due to the taxi unions and different legislations it seems like we're slowing being forced to follow the same guidelines as cab drivers., Get a phone number not everyone wants to text you their problems.
﻿Driver Uber-X, Flexible schedule good driver support at times. Weekly pay., Horrible support pay is not worth the expense  or wear & tear on your vehicle. company does not support its drivers it favors the customer every time. The navigation is horrible. The application is unreliable & does not work sufficiently. It can send you 20 miles out of your way for a 2 mile trip. Pay is horrible., Improve the pay improve the navigation. hire people that support the drivers.
﻿Terrible company, I cannot think of any pros to working for this company. Terribly managed service. Will never recommend that anyone works for these people. Lyft is a much better alternative and I hope that more people start steering away from uber and go with lyft., Garbage can company. They will terminate your account for any reason. I was recently terminated for picking up to many free fares over a weekend in Delray. Free fares?? Like I have control over who I pick up?? Smh, I am currently using your company over the free fare issue. Seems as if uber enjoys being sued. Get with it. Your business model is going to he changed forever in the short term. I welcome plenty of lawsuits going forward.
﻿Driver, , , 
﻿Senior Operations Lead, Amazing company highly recommended for everyone and anyone that loves building/creating their own business., A lot of responsibility high accountability and relentless expectation to execute., Entrepreneurs welcome.
﻿Driver- Miami/Hollywood/Ft.Lauderdale, Better than LYFT. Flexible Hours. Easy to create your own schedule without being micro-managed. If you know your city and traffic patterns you'll be fine. Direct Deposit every week. Relatively easy just be nice., You MUST work during surging hours to make it worth your while: UBER takes 20%+ out of the total trip. Addresses are not always accurate. Last minute cancellation from riders. Rider contact info sometimes unavailable., Better compensation for excellent drivers with above average ratings positive comments and high fares/hour. Expand what you consider to be an UBER SELECT vehicle. Year make and model don't always constitute quality of care and luxury.
﻿driver, set own schedule and flexibility, low rates makes job no good full time, they wont listen to us anywazys
﻿Campus Brand Ambassador for Uber, Poor benefits no reduced or free rides no consistent source of income. Hiring process a pain...uber is just pulling some legal stunt instead of just hiring their employees directly., You missed out on a lot of key opportunities to reach out to people that are not familiar with uber i.e. welcome week football games spring admit welcome sessions...you need to provide more support for your CBAs and not just expect them to go out and find riders all on their own., 
﻿The Risks of Being an Uber Driver, Flexible schedule decent pay not exhausting interesting to drive places where you wouldn't normally go customers are nice time flies., Although there are some training videos Uber does not provide enough information on the risks of being an Uber driver. These risks include increased chance of getting in an accident and increased risk of getting a citation. You are not only increasing your risk by driving more but also by driving in areas you are unfamiliar with and picking up and dropping off customers especially in dense parts of cities like San Francisco....., Provide more extensive training videos and maybe a mini course on the risks of being an Uber driver. Maybe connect new drivers with more experienced drivers so that we can learn from them. You need to make people understand that even if they've had a great driving record for years they will run into unexpected problems driving for Uber.
﻿Good for side income but not much else, A lot of what everyone else has said: You set your own schedule you get 80% of every fare it's a way to meet new people. It's a decent way to earn some extra income but if you work in a small market or if Uber is new to your area you probably won't want to do this full-time., It took me a long time to really nail down why I dislike driving for Uber but here are a few short points: - Rates change frequently. When I started we were getting paid $1.50 per mile. Now we get 75 cents per mile. Operations claims that lower rates = more money but I've noticed that the exact opposite is true (which is fair since that totally makes sense). - They're constantly onboarding new drivers which means..., You're already cheaper than taxis so consider raising the fares to make driving more lucrative. Cutting the fares might be attractive to potential customers but it makes driving a lot less worthwhile because it forces us to do a lot more for a lot less. Also more transparency about policy changes would be great. The fact that you continue to disseminate false information to drivers about airport pickups is shameful...
﻿Not worth the time or wasted effort, You don't have to rent a cab to make $ get to meet people anytime schedule, Uber is always trying to lure new drivers on a weekly basis with eye popping headlines in their ads like: Make 1000 a week! or earn 35k in fares from now until december!. The reason they are lying is because there is so much driver turnover at uber. Also Uber has special fares for customers that want to travel short distances (1-4 miles) and those fares are $5.00. When an Uber contractor takes that fare he/she..., You need to raise fares and grasp the concept of the true cost of vehicle ownership in relation to using it for uber. You also should grant drivers a fuel surcharge per trip as well as eliminate the safe trip fee. Making the uber driver pay for your insurance should come out of your commission not a separate charge to the uber driver. Very selfish.
﻿Do the math !!, You control you work time, You were and tear you own car !, Do this if you are retired or have a different and better source of income.
﻿Designer, One of the most interesting companies that is out there. Being able to actually make a difference in peoples lives and see that impact is greatly rewarding., Can feel slow moving since it's a fast growing company but not really a con., 
﻿VOMIT is AWESOME, , , 
﻿Bad deal !, Know peoples cultures some fun sometimes but i dont have 20 words for say about pros only cons about that is it!, Uber and false promises in advertisements say you work when you want as you want which is a lie if you do not work when they want they don't give you the trips where they want and if not the. high season you do not make money besides you put many miles on the car the rider drunk vomit in the car  scratch pen with the bank finally destroy your car the car necessarily has to be in 2011 I do not think the Uber..., Watch your uber and false promises in advertisements say you work when you want as you want which is a lie if you do not work when they want they do not pass on the trips and off-season you do not make money besides you put many miles on the car the hitchhikers often drunk vomit in the car scratch pen with the bank finally destroy his car which necessarily has to be in 2011 I do not think the Uber a good deal!
﻿UberX Driver, Cannot be more flexible Work whenever you want See more of the city Become an expert in navigation Occasionally meet cool customers, Trading in the value of my car for a paycheck Many passengers are not good company No opportunities to meet co-workers, Keep up the good work! Improve the app handoff to navigation process Boot bad customers!

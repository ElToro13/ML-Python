# Topic Modelling of Uber from reviews scrapped from Glassdoor
### Introduction
In this project, we make use of reviews people have posted on Glassdoor regarding working at Uber. Using Scikit-learn library, we try to classify the reviews into Topics based on what they are saying using LDA. LDA is a probalistic model where it helps find relation between words in the corpus and help cluster them so we can classify the corpus into sub-topics.  

The project is divided into two parts. **Data Collection** and **Analysis**

## Data Collection
A Python Script that scraps review like "Pros", "Cons" and "Advice to Management" from Glassdoor website. 

## Analysis
Once we have the csv file, we used various Python based libraries to analysis and display the results. 
Following results were analyzed and plotted.

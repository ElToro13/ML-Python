two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.
The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data
(median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality 
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). 

The Task is to predict the quality of wine based on the data given.

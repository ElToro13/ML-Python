# PoS Tagger using Scikit-learn, NLTK and Python
Sklearn is very useful machine learning library for Python Prograaming Language. It has many 
classifiers, metrics calculations, implemented which we can make use of. 
Here we use <br/>
\* **Decision Tree Classifier** <br/>
\* **Naive Bayes** <br/>
\* **Neural Network** <br/>
for classification of our PoS Tagger <br/>

\* **NLTK is a natural language processing toolkit designed for Python.**
